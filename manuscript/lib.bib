	abstract = {Gap distributions in forests reflect the spatial impact of man-made tree harvesting or naturally-induced patterns of tree death being caused by windthrow, inter-tree competition, disease or senescence. Gap sizes can vary from large (\&gt;100 m2) to small  (\&lt;10 m2), and they may have contrasting spatial patterns, such as being aggregated or regularly distributed. However, very small gaps cannot easily be recorded with conventional aerial or satellite images, which calls for new and cost-effective methodologies of forest monitoring. Here, we used an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and very high-resolution images to record the gaps in 10 temperate managed and unmanaged forests in two regions of Germany. All gaps were extracted for 1-ha study plots and subsequently analyzed with spatially-explicit statistics, such as the conventional  pair correlation function (PCF), the polygon-based PCF and the mark correlation function. Gap-size frequency was dominated by small gaps of an area \&lt;5 m2, which were particularly frequent in unmanaged forests. We found that gap distances showed a variety of patterns. However, the polygon-based PCF was a better descriptor of patterns than the conventional PCF, because it showed randomness or aggregation for cases when the conventional PCF showed small-scale regularity; albeit, the latter was only a mathematical artifact. The mark correlation function revealed that gap areas were in half of the cases negatively correlated and in the other half independent. Negative size correlations may likely be the result of single-tree harvesting or of repeated gap formation, which both lead to nearby small gaps. Here, we emphasize the usefulness of UAV to record forest gaps of a very small size. These small gaps may originate from repeated gap-creating disturbances, and their spatial patterns should be monitored with spatially-explicit statistics at recurring intervals in order to further insights into forest dynamics.},

	abstract = {Precision agriculture (PA) is the application of geospatial techniques and sensors (e.g., geographic information systems, remote sensing, GPS) to identify variations in the field and to deal with them using alternative strategies. In particular, high-resolution satellite imagery is now more commonly used to study these variations for crop and soil conditions. However, the availability and the often prohibitive costs of such imagery would suggest an alternative product for this particular application in PA. Specifically, images taken by low altitude remote sensing platforms, or small unmanned aerial systems (UAS), are shown to be a potential alternative given their low cost of operation in environmental monitoring, high spatial and temporal resolution, and their high flexibility in image acquisition programming. Not surprisingly, there have been several recent studies in the application of UAS imagery for PA. The results of these studies would indicate that, to provide a reliable end product to farmers, advances in platform design, production, standardization of image georeferencing and mosaicing, and information extraction workflow are required. Moreover, it is suggested that such endeavors should involve the farmer, particularly in the process of field design, image acquisition, image interpretation and analysis.},

	abstract = {Many high-risk plant pathogens are transported over long distances (hundreds of meters to thousands of kilometers) in the atmosphere. The ability to track the movement of these pathogens in the atmosphere is essential for forecasting disease spread and establishing effective quarantine measures. Here, we discuss the scales of atmospheric dispersal of plant pathogens along a transport continuum (pathogen scale, farm scale, regional scale, and continental scale). Growers can use risk information at each of these dispersal scales to assist in making plant disease management decisions, such as the timely application of appropriate pesticides. Regional- and continental-scale atmospheric features known as Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs) may shuffle plant pathogens along highways in the sky. A promising new method relying on overlapping turbulent back-trajectories of pathogen-laden parcels of air may assist in localizing potential inoculum sources, informing local and/or regional management efforts such as conservation tillage. The emergence of unmanned aircraft systems (UASs, or drones) to sample plant pathogens in the lower atmosphere, coupled with source localization efforts, could aid in mitigating the spread of high-risk plant pathogens.},

Recent technological innovations have led to an upsurge in the availability of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) – aircraft remotely operated from the ground – and there are now many lightweight UAVs on offer at reasonable costs. Flying low and slow, UAVs offer ecologists new opportunities for scale-appropriate measurements of ecological phenomena. Equipped with capable sensors, UAVs can deliver fine spatial resolution data at temporal resolutions defined by the end user. Recent innovations in UAV platform design have been accompanied by improvements in navigation and the miniaturization of measurement technologies, allowing the study of individual organisms and their spatiotemporal dynamics at close range.},

	abstract = {Rust fungi are important components of ecological communities and in ecosystem function. Their unique life strategies as biotrophic pathogens with complicated life cycles could make them vulnerable to global environmental change. While there are gaps in our knowledge, especially in natural plant–rust systems, this review of the exposure of rust fungi to global change parameters revealed that some host–rust relationships would decline under predicted environmental change scenarios, whereas others would either remain unchanged or become more prevalent. Notably, some graminicolous rusts are negatively affected by higher temperatures and increased concentrations of atmospheric CO2. An increase of atmospheric O3 appears to favour rust diseases on trees but not those on grasses. Combined effects of CO2 and O3 are intermediary. The most important global drivers for the geographical and host plant range expansion and prevalence of rusts, however, are global plant trade, host plant genetic homogenization and the regular occurrence of conducive environmental conditions, especially the availability of moisture. However, while rusts thrive in high-humidity environments, they can also survive in desert habitats, and as a group their environmental tolerance is large, with no conclusive change in their overall prevalence predictable to date.},

	doi = {10.1023/A:1004327224729},
	abstract = {A leaf-height-seed (LHS) plant ecology strategy scheme is proposed. The axes would be specific leaf area SLA (light-capturing area deployed per dry mass allocated), height of the plant's canopy at maturity, and seed mass. All axes would be log-scaled. The strategy of a species would be described by its position in the volume formed by the three axes. The advantages of the LHS scheme can be understood by comparing it to Grime's CSR scheme, which has Competitors, Stress-tolerators and Ruderals at the corners of a triangle. The CSR triangle is widely cited as expressing important strategic variation between species. The C–S axis reflects variation in responsiveness to opportunities for rapid growth; in the LHS scheme, SLA reflects the same type of variation. The R axis reflects coping with disturbance; in the LHS scheme, height and seed mass reflect separate aspects of coping with disturbance. A plant ecology strategy scheme that permitted any species worldwide to be readily positioned within the scheme could bring substantial benefits for improved meta-analysis of experimental results, for placing detailed ecophysiology in context, and for coping with questions posed by global change. In the CSR triangle the axes are defined by reference to concepts, there is no simple protocol for positioning species beyond the reference datasets within the scheme, and consequently benefits of worldwide comparison have not materialized. LHS does permit any vascular land plant species to be positioned within the scheme, without time-consuming measurement of metabolic rates or of field performance relative to other species. The merits of the LHS scheme reside (it is argued) in this potential for worldwide comparison, more than in superior explanatory power within any particular vegetation region. The LHS scheme avoids also two other difficulties with the CSR scheme: (a) It does not prejudge that there are no viable strategies under high stress and high disturbance (the missing quadrant in the CSR triangle compared to a two-axis rectangle); (b) It separates out two distinct aspects of the response to disturbance, height at maturity expressing the amount of growth attempted between disturbances, and seed mass (inverse of seed output per unit reproductive effort) expressing the capacity to colonize growth opportunities at a distance. The advantage of LHS axes defined through a single readily-measured variable needs to be weighed against the disadvantage that single plant traits may not capture as much strategy variation as CSR's multi-trait axes. It is argued that the benefits of potential worldwide comparison do actually outweigh any decrease in the proportion of meaningful variation between species that is captured. Further, the LHS scheme opens the path to quantifying what proportion of variation in any other ecologically-relevant trait is correlated with the LHS axes. This quantification could help us to move forward from unprofitable debates of the past 30 years, where CSR opponents have emphasized patterns that were not accommodated within the scheme, while CSR proponents have emphasized patterns that the scheme did account for.},

	abstract = {There is increasing pressure to reduce the use of pesticides in modern crop production to decrease the environmental impact of current practice and to lower production costs. It is therefore imperative that sprays are only applied when and where needed. Since diseases in fields are frequently patchy, sprays may be applied unnecessarily to disease-free areas. Disease control could be more efficient if disease patches within fields could be identified and spray applied only to the infected areas. Recent developments in optical sensor technology have the potential to enable direct detection of foliar disease under field conditions. This review assesses recent developments in the use of optical methods for detecting foliar disease, evaluates the likely benefits of spatially selective disease control in field crops, and discusses practicalities and limitations of using optical disease detection systems for crop protection in precision pest management.},

	abstract = {Invasion of non-native plant species, which has a significant impact on the earth’s ecosystems, has greatly increased in recent years due to expanding trade and transport among different countries. Understanding the ecological principles underlying the invasive process as well as the characteristics of the invasive plants is crucial for making good management decisions to address this problem. Invasive Plant Ecology includes chapters derived from presentations at conferences such as the World Congress of the International Union of Forestry Research Organizations (IUFRO), as well as contributions from invited renowned authors. The chapters include both original research and syntheses of current knowledge on specific topics.Actions essential for coordinated approaches to curtail plant invasion include increasing awareness of the ecological impacts of alien plants and employing novel control strategies. This book provides a foundation in invasion ecology by examining ecological theories and case studies that explain plant invasions, their impacts, management strategies, and the ecological economics. The chapters describe ecological characteristics, mutualistic associations, microbial communities, and disturbance regimes that affect the spread of invasive plants. The book also covers spatial analysis and predictive modeling of invasive plants.The final chapters offer guidelines for ecological management and restoration of invaded areas and describe the economics of the invasive plant issue. This collection contains case studies from around the world, giving readers a real view of the extent of the invasive species issue along with real-world strategies. With its focus on the ecological aspects of plant invasion, this book provides an important reference for students, scientists, professionals, and policy makers who are involved in the study and management of alien invasive plants and ecosystems.},

	isbn = {978-3-642-54435-4},
	abstract = {Seit 120 Jahren liegt die Stärke des STRASBURGERs in der ausgewogenen Darstellung aller Teilgebiete der Pflanzenwissenschaften. Die vorliegende 37. Auflage ist nicht nur aktualisiert, sondern durch die Einführung der Teile Genetik und Entwicklung auch neu strukturiert worden. Trotz neu aufgenommener Themen konnte durch Straffung des Textes und Kürzung an anderer Stelle der Gesamtumfang leicht reduziert werden, was der Lesbarkeit dieses sehr umfangreichen Werkes zugutekommen sollte.Der Teil Struktur beschreibt die Biologie der Pflanzenzelle und reicht bis zur Morphologie der Samenpflanzen. Besonderes Augenmerk wird auf eine einheitliche und international gebräuchliche Nomenklatur gelegt. Neu in diesen Teil eingearbeitet wurden die Morphologie, Anatomie und Funktion der Reproduktionsorgane der Samenpflanzen, die in älteren Auflagen im Teil Evolution und Systematik zu finden waren. Im neuen Teil Genetik wurden in der letzten Auflage auf unterschiedliche Kapitel verteilte Abschnitte übersichtlich zusammengeführt und durch neuere Erkenntnisse, besonders in der Epigenetik und Gentechnik, erweitert.Der ebenfalls neue Teil Entwicklung umfasst relevante Abschnitte aus dem Teil Physiologie der letzten Ausgabe, die separat und aktualisiert wiedergegeben werden. Erläutert wird die Entstehung vielzelliger Pflanzen aus einzelnen Zellen unter dem Einfluss endogener und exogener regulatorischer Faktoren.Im Teil Physiologie werden ausgehend von der Beschreibung grundlegender Transport- und Stoffwechselprozesse die Anpassung des pflanzlichen Stoffwechsels an entwicklungs- und umweltbedingte Veränderungen betrachtet. Die Abschnitte zum Primärstoffwechsel wurden ergänzt und überarbeitet und die übrigen Teile aktualisiert.Der evolutionäre Prozess, die Phylogenie und Systematik der Pflanzen und anderer photoautotropher Eukaryoten sowie die Geschichte der Vegetation der Erde sind Inhalt des Teils Evolution und Systematik. Im Vergleich zur 36. Aufl. ist vor allem die Darstellung der Pilze sehr verändert und auf pflanzenrelevante Aspekte reduziert worden. Im Ökologie-Teil wird die Pflanze in Beziehung zu den Lebensbedingungen am Wuchsort gesetzt. Pflanzliche Reaktionen auf Klima und Bodenfaktoren, Prozesse in Populationen und Artengemeinschaften sowie die großen Vegetationszonen der Erde werden erklärt. In dieser Auflage wurden einige regionale Aspekte zu Gunsten einer stärker globalen Sicht reduziert. Einige Abbildungen wurden neu gestaltet.Der Tradition dieses einzigartigen Standardwerkes entsprechend soll es Studierenden als vierfarbig bebildertes Lehrbuch und Dozenten aller bio-, umwelt- und agrarwissenschaftlichen Fachrichtungen als verlässliches Nachschlage- und Referenzwerk dienen.},

After reviewing these two approaches, it then explains how models based on the Maximum Entropy Formalism can be used to predict the relative abundance of different species from a potential species pool. Following this it shows how the trait constraints, upon which the model is based, are necessary consequences of natural selection and population dynamics. The final sections of the book extend the discussion to macroecological patterns of species abundance and concludes with some outstanding unresolved questions."--Balogh International.},

R is now in widespread use for teaching at many levels as well as for practical data analysis and methodological development. This book provides an elementary-level introduction to R, targeting both non-statistician scientists in various fields and students of statistics. The main mode of presentation is via code examples with liberal commenting of the code and the output, from the computational as well as the statistical viewpoint. A supplementary R package can be downloaded and contains the data sets. The statistical methodology includes statistical standard distributions, one- and two-sample tests with continuous data, regression analysis, one- and two-way analysis of variance, regression analysis, analysis of tabular data, and sample size calculations. In addition, the last six chapters contain introductions to multiple linear regression analysis, linear models in general, logistic regression, survival analysis, Poisson regression, and nonlinear regression. In the second edition, the text and code have been updated to R version 2.6.2. The last two methodological chapters are new, as is a chapter on advanced data handling. The introductory chapter has been extended and reorganized as two chapters. Exercises have been revised and answers are now provided in an Appendix.},

	abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book\&\#39;s coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression \&amp; path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for ``wide\&\#39;\&\#39; data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates.},

	url = {http://www.publish.csiro.au/paper/BT8310089},
	abstract = {A study of the relative abundance of several groups of plant parasitic fungi in various countries suggests that the native floras of Australia and New Zealand are deficient in some groups relatively common elsewhere. Evidence for such deficiencies is presented for the genera Synchytrium and Physoderma and the orders Peronosporales, Taphrinales and Erysiphales. These deficiencies extend in varying degrees to the floras of South America and South Africa and indicate several differences between the fungal floras of the northern and southern hemispheres. It is suggested that similar comparative studies of many other fungal groups need to be made. In the Erysiphales, the number of known perithecial species in Australia and New Zealand is small by comparison with northern hemisphere countries and details of these species are given. A comparison is made also of the occurrence in various countries of rust parasites (Uredinales) on the families Myrtaceae and Proteaceae and on the genera Acacia and Cardamine, and of the gallforming fungi in the family Cryptobasidiaceae on their hosts in the families Lauraceae and Rhamnaceae. All known rusts of Myrtaceae and Proteaceae are listed with their hosts and geographic distribution. The Myrtaceous rusts occur mainly in Central and South America on the subfamily Myrtoideae. Uredo xanthostemonis sp. nov. is described on two Xanthostemon spp. from the Northern Territory and is the only known rust on Myrtaceae in Australia. Phakopsora juelii P. \& H. Syd., described from uredinia, is placed as Uredo juelii nom. nov. The distribution of rust susceptibility amongst the genera and subfamilies of the Myrtaceae and various dubious rust records on the family are discussed. On the Proteaceae, two of the three known rusts occur on related hosts in the Australasian region with the third in Central America. Uredo angiosperma Thurn. on Hakea in Western Australia is redescribed from the type and later collections, and its host determined as H. prostrata R.Br. On Acacia, the rust genus Uromycladium predominates in Australia, with Ravenelia the main genus in Africa and the Americas. All Uromyces species on Acacia are listed and studies in progress show that all probably belong in other rust genera. On Cardamine, a previously unrecognized subspecies, Puccinia cruciferarum subsp. inornata (G. H. Cunn.) comb. nov., is reported from New Zealand and Australia and its relationship to the various other known subspecies on Cardamine in the northern hemisphere discussed. The family Cryptobasidiaceae is recognized in Australia for the first time, with one named species, Drepanoconis nesodaphnes (Berk. \& Br.) comb. nov., and one unnamed taxon. They cause galls on native species in the Lauraceous genera Cinnamomum and Beilschmiedia in eastern Australia and are related to several Cryptobasidiaceous species on Lauraceae in Central and South America. All known species in the family are listed. Further study is needed to clarify their possible basidiomycetous nature and the relationship of the American and Australian genera and species on Lauraceae to the monotypic genus Coniodictyum causing galls on Ziziphus (Rhamnaceae) in Africa. Studies such as this on the relative abundance in different countries of fungal parasites may provide information of value to botanists in studies on the origin and distribution of plants. Much more exploration of the Australian flora is needed as the native fungi of Australia are poorly known and accurate comparisons with other countries are not possible with many groups. In this paper, several taxa, including one family, are recognized for the first time in Australia and further collecting could alter some of the distributions presented here. In addition to those mentioned above, species of Physoderma on Swainsona and Poa, the genus Ovulariopsis (on Hardenbergia and Kennedia), Erysiphe aft ulmariae Desm. on Acaena and a species of Ravenelia on Acacia farnesiana are newly recorded for Australia. Taxonomic and specimen details are given for several species.},

	abstract = {Partial ß-tubulin 1 sequence data were obtained for 80 taxa of Pucciniaceae, with hosts from 33 angiosperm families, covering all major ordinal groups in the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification. As in previous studies, most species of Puccinia and Uromyces fell into two main clades (I and II), with P. glechomatis and P. psidii excluded from Pucciniaceae. Results suggest two processes; a coevolution of and hosts in each clade, as well as associated frequent jumps to ecologically close, but taxonomically distant, hosts. Clade I contained all rusts on Cyperaceae and Juncaceae, and most rusts on host orders from rosids to euasterids II. Clade II contained all rusts on Poaceae, and most on host orders from monocots to core eudicots. In both main clades, several well-supported subclades were identified. The grouping in clade I, subclade E of rusts of Cyperaceae and Asteraceae and, in particular, of an Australian isolate of P. dioicae with rusts on Australian families of Asterales, suggested a local radiation, and supported the coevolutionary relationship between rusts on these two families seen with a different range of asteraceous rusts in the Northern Hemisphere. In clade I, two clades contained only rusts of Asteraceae and Fabaceae, respectively, and in clade II, subclade F contained only rusts of pooid hosts. Rusts on non-pooid hosts were separated from them in subclade G. Other subclades contained a range of rusts on distantly related angiosperm families. Urediniospore morphology was often, but not always, correlated with the molecular phylogeny. Most rusts with urediniospores having few (1–5) equatorial germ pores were in clade I, whereas most with spores having several (5–14) scattered pores were in clade II. The distribution of telial host families on the ß-tubulin rust phylogeny was not random. Aecial hosts of heteroecious rusts played an important role in the evolutionary process. Possible examples of host jumps were seen in rusts on Geraniaceae, Polygonaceae, and Apiaceae. Despite such jumps obscuring past host associations, possible ancestral hosts were identified by the pattern of host distribution at higher taxonomic levels along the ß-tubulin phylogeny. Results suggest that clade I diverged with Cyperaceae, Juncaceae, and the more advanced core eudicot orders (rosids and asterids), whereas clade II diversified with earlier angiosperm groups, such as monocots, Poaceae, and Ranunculales. Qualified support was given to the hypothesis that rusts can reveal taxonomic relationships between their hosts, at genus, family, and ordinal levels.},

A number of diseases result in serious losses to this economically important forest resource. Eucalyptus rust, caused by Puccinia psidii, is one such example. The economic losses due to this disease are the result of infections of seedlings, young trees, and coppice. P. psidii occurs predominately in Central and South America, but reports of a similar rust are known from other areas. Eucalyptus rust is a remarkable disease in that the pathogen is not known on eucalypts in their centers of origin. It has apparently originated on native Myrtaceae in South America and is highly infective on some Eucalyptus spp. planted there. P. psidii causes one of the most serious forestry diseases in Brazil and is considered to be the most serious threat to eucalypt plantations worldwide. Advances in eucalyptus rust research are reviewed here, with a focus on topics such as distribution, host range, pathogen specialization, symptomatology, etiology, epidemiology, and control.},

In the present work 27 provenances of 12 Eucalyptus species were screened for resistance to P. psidii present in the southern part of the State of Bahia, Brazil. Provenances of Eucalyptus pellita, E. urophylla E tereticornis, E. resinifera E camaldulensis, E. citriodora, E. microcorys and E. paniculata showed resistance to the population of P. psidii from South Bahia. Highly susceptible materials were detected among provenances of E. grandis and E. cloeziana. These results differed from previous observations in the neighbouring State of Minas Gerais. This suggests differences in pathogenic behaviour of the populations of P. psidii from those two areas.},

	abstract = {Non-indigenous pathogenic fungi increasingly threaten North American tree species. Ecosystems may be fundamentally changed when abundant tree species are functionally eliminated, as occurred with American chestnut (Castanea dentata (Marsh.) Borkh.). Conversely, changes may be more subtle but still significant and long lasting when populations are lost, or all trees in the larger size classes are killed. Proposed approaches for characterizing the magnitude of ecological impacts use characteristics of both the non-indigenous pathogen and the host species. Impacts are most significant when highly successful invading pathogens attack foundation species, setting in motion a long-lasting cascade of effects on the host and associated species. Such impacts have generally not been well documented at the ecosystem level. Several North American forest tree species have been functionally eliminated or severely reduced by non-indigenous pathogens. Historical invasions, such as that of chestnut blight (Cryphonectria parasitica (Murr.) Bar), caused very significant ecological impacts that will never be completely understood because of lack of quantitative data. Beech bark disease, caused by a combination of an introduced scale insect (Cryptococcus fagisuga Lindinger) and a fungus (Neonectria faginata (Lohman et al.) Castl. \& Rossman), is still advancing and provides opportunities for studying ecosystem-level impacts when a major tree species is removed or markedly reduced in abundance from the overstorey. Butternut canker, caused by the fungus, Sirococcus clavigignenti-juglandacearum N.B. Nair, Kostichka \& Kuntz, has spread throughout the host range, endangering species’ survival. Other non-indigenous invasive fungi such as Cronartium ribicola J.C. Fisch and Phytophthora lateralis Tucker \& Milbrath continue to move into new populations, causing high mortality and associated restructuring of these ecosystems. Global trade and environmental change trends will ensure new challenges by non-indigenous fungal pathogens, presenting an urgent need for improved understanding of long-term impacts across ecological systems.},

Participation in community gardening has ebbed and flowed in response to changing socioeconomic conditions, and thus the current economic recession has reheightened public interest. In a review of the scholarly literature from 1999 to 2010, rigorous quantitative research studies on the effects of community gardens are found to be sparse; however, a larger body of qualitative data is available. Eleven themes related to the purposes, benefits of, and motivations for participating in community gardens are identified. Community gardens can serve as an effective tool for community-based practitioners in carrying out their roles within the arenas of organizing, development, and change.},

	abstract = {Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) offers high potential as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for disease detection. In this paper leaf characteristics and spectral reflectance of sugar beet leaves diseased with Cercospora leaf spot, powdery mildew and leaf rust at different development stages were connected. Light microscopy was used to describe the morphological changes in the host tissue due to pathogen colonisation. Under controlled conditions a hyperspectral imaging line scanning spectrometer (ImSpector V10E) with a spectral resolution of 2.8 nm from 400 to 1000 nm and a spatial resolution of 0.19 mm was used for continuous screening and monitoring of disease symptoms during pathogenesis. A pixel-wise mapping of spectral reflectance in the visible and near-infrared range enabled the detection and detailed description of diseased tissue on the leaf level. Leaf structure was linked to leaf spectral reflectance patterns. Depending on the interaction with the host tissue, the pathogens caused disease-specific spectral signatures. The influence of the pathogens on leaf reflectance was a function of the developmental stage of the disease and of the subarea of the symptoms. Spectral reflectance in combination with Spectral Angle Mapper classification allowed for the differentiation of mature symptoms into zones displaying all ontogenetic stages from young to mature symptoms. Due to a pixel-wise extraction of pure spectral signatures a better understanding of changes in leaf reflectance caused by plant diseases was achieved using HSI. This technology considerably improves the sensitivity and specificity of hyperspectrometry in proximal sensing of plant diseases.},

This pathogen is hypothesized to be endemic to South and Central America and to have first infected eucalypts via a host jump from native guava (Psidium guajava). Ten microsatellite markers were used to genotype 148 P. psidii samples from eucalypts and guava plus five additional myrtaceous hosts across a wide geographic range of south-eastern Brazil and Uruguay. Principal coordinates analysis, a Bayesian clustering analysis and a minimum-spanning network revealed two major genetic clusters among the sampled isolates, one associated with guava and another associated with eucalypts and three additional hosts. Multilocus genotypes infecting guava differed by multiple mutational steps at eight loci compared with those infecting eucalypts. Approximate Bayesian computation revealed that evolutionary scenarios involving a coalescence event between guava- and eucalypt-associated pathogen populations within the past 1000 years are highly unlikely. None of the analyses supported the hypothesis that eucalypt-infecting P. psidii in Brazil originated via host jump from guava following the introduction of eucalypts to Brazil approximately 185 years ago. The existence of host-associated biotypes of P. psidii in Brazil indicates that this diversity must be considered when assessing the invasive threat posed by this pathogen to myrtaceous hosts worldwide.},

In Puccinia psidii an appressorium forms at the tip of a short germ-tube and from it an infection peg penetrates between epidermal cells to establish an intercellular mycelium with haustoria in the host leaf. In Ravenelia humphreyana appressoria are frequently produced sessile to the uredospore and an infection peg penetrates directly into an epidermal cell of the leaf and enlarges as a vesicular haustorium; adjacent cells become similarly infected without the establishment of an intercellular mycelium. These mechanisms of penetration are discussed in relation to the behaviour of the germ-tube and the process of appressorium formation.},

	abstract = {Puccinia psidii has long been considered a significant threat to Australian plant industries and ecosystems. In April 2010, P. psidii was detected for the first time in Australia on the central coast of New South Wales (NSW). The fungus spread rapidly along the east coast and in December 2010 was found in Queensland (Qld) followed by Victoria a year later. Puccinia psidii was initially restricted to the southeastern part of Qld but spread as far north as Mossman. In Qld, 48 species of Myrtaceae are considered highly or extremely susceptible to the disease. The impact of P. psidii on individual trees and shrubs has ranged from minor leaf spots, foliage, stem and branch dieback to reduced fecundity. Tree death, as a result of repeated infection, has been recorded for Rhodomyrtus psidioides. Rust infection has also been recorded on flower buds, flowers and fruits of 28 host species. Morphological and molecular characteristics were used to confirm the identification of P. psidii from a range of Myrtaceae in Qld and compared with isolates from NSW and overseas. A reconstructed phylogeny based on the LSU and SSU regions of rDNA did not resolve the familial placement of P. psidii, but indicated that it does not belong to the Pucciniaceae. Uredo rangelii was found to be con-specific with all isolates of P. psidii in morphology, ITS and LSU sequence data, and host range.},

The latter has been reported as a host of the rust in Porto Rico, but is apparently immune from the pimento and rose apple (Eugenia jatnbos] strains. The expanding foliage, inflorescences, and succulent young twigs are all attacked, while the new leaves formed to replace the fallen ones in turn become diseased.

	abstract = {* Increasingly, ecologists are using functional and phylogenetic approaches to quantify the relative importance of stochastic, abiotic filtering and biotic filtering processes shaping the pattern of species co-occurrence. A remaining challenge in functional and phylogenetic analyses of tropical tree communities is to successfully integrate the functional and phylogenetic structure of tree communities across spatial and size scales and habitats in a single analysis.

* We analysed the functional and phylogenetic structure of tree assemblages in a 20-ha tropical forest dynamics plot in south-west China. Because the influence of biotic interactions may become more apparent as cohorts age, on local scales, and in resource-rich environments, we perform our analyses across three size classes, six spatial scales and six distinct habitat types, using 10 plant functional traits and a molecular phylogeny for the {\textgreater}400 tree taxa found in the plot.

* All traits, except leaf area and stem-specific resistance, had significant, albeit weak phylogenetic signal. For canopy species, phylogenetic clustering in small and medium size classes turned to phylogenetic overdispersion in the largest size class and this change in dispersion with size was found in each habitat type and across all spatial scales. On fine spatial scales, functional dispersion changed from clustering to overdispersion with increasing size classes. However, on larger spatial scales assemblages were functionally clustered for all size classes and habitats.

* Phylogenetic and functional structure across spatial and size scales and habitats gave strong support for a deterministic model of species co-occurrence rather than for a neutral model. The results also support the hypothesis that abiotic determinism is more important at larger scales, while biotic determinism is more important on smaller scales within habitats.},

	abstract = {Tropical forest functional diversity, which is a measure of the diversity of organismal interactions with the environment, is poorly understood despite its importance for linking evolutionary biology to ecosystem biogeochemistry. Functional diversity is reflected in functional traits such as the concentrations of different compounds in leaves or the density of leaf mass, which are related to plant activities such as plant defence, nutrient cycling, or growth. In the Amazonian lowlands, river movement and microtopography control nutrient mobility, which may influence functional trait distributions. Here we use airborne laser-guided imaging spectroscopy to develop maps of 16 forest canopy traits, throughout four large landscapes that harbour three common forest community types on the Madre de Dios and Tambopata rivers in southwestern Amazonia. Our maps, which are based on quantitative chemometric analysis of forest canopies with visible-to-near infrared (400–2,500 nm) spectroscopy, reveal substantial variation in canopy traits and their distributions within and among forested landscapes. Forest canopy trait distributions are arranged in a nested pattern, with location along rivers controlling trait variation between different landscapes, and microtopography controlling trait variation within landscapes. We suggest that processes of nutrient deposition and depletion drive increasing phosphorus limitation, and a corresponding increase in plant defence, in an eastward direction from the base of the Andes into the Amazon Basin.

	abstract = {With globalisation, the world’s native biotas are increasingly exposed to disease, parasitism, herbivory and competition from exotic organisms. The vulnerability of native biota to these exotic invasions is exacerbated by human disturbance and global climate change. Rust pathogens are some of the most important plant pathogens, including Puccinia psidii (myrtle rust or guava rust) that is now spreading worldwide at an alarming rate. P. psidii is native to South America and affects species in the family Myrtaceae, including the economically and ecologically important eucalypts. The Australian continent has a rich myrtaceous flora and is the centre of origin of most eucalypt species. P. psidii was first detected in Australia in 2010 and has since rapidly spread along its east coast. We assess the risk this exotic pathogen poses to the eucalypt flora of the southern Australian island of Tasmania, where the first incursion of P. psidii was detected in early 2015. Specifically, we tested the relative importance of phylogenetic history, habitat, endemism, and range size in predicting host susceptibility.

Rust screening of seedlings from one to four populations of each of the 30 eucalypt species which are native to Tasmania, revealed significant genetic-based variation in response among host species and populations within the species. Significant population differences in susceptibility were detected in threatened, rare and endemic eucalypt species, as well as Australia’s main plantation eucalypt (Eucalyptus globulus) and the world’s tallest angiosperm species (Eucalyptus regnans). A significant proportion of the variation in host species susceptibility to this exotic pathogen was explained by phylogenetic history, while factors such as habitat, endemism and range size had no detectable effect. Species from subgenus Eucalyptus (13 species) were more susceptible than those from subgenus Symphyomyrtus (17 species) due to differences between the subgenera in the proportion of plants showing a symptomless response. These subgenera are here shown to differ in their leaf oil and wax chemistry. The potential contribution of these differences and other possible mechanisms causing these subgeneric differences in susceptibility are discussed. This study demonstrates the power of a phylogenetic approach to risk assessment for biosecurity and highlights the need for broader resistance screening within and between populations of species of high conservation or economic value.},

The effectiveness of a range of chlorine solutions was investigated using barley samples artificially contaminated with four different concentrations of Aspergillus flavus, A. niger, A. ochraceus, Eurotium repens, Penicillium brevicompactum P. chrysogenum and Cladosporium cladosporioides. At initial contamination levels greater than 104/g, 0.4\% chlorine did not inactivate sufficient spores to produce less than 20\% contamination. Of the test fungi, ascospores of E. repens were the most resistant to chlorine inactivation, whereas the conidia of C. cladosporioides were the most sensitive. Rinsing the samples with 70\% ethanol improved the effectiveness of the recommended surface disinfection procedure. However, some ethanol appears to permeate into the grains and may inactivate sensitive internal fungi, although a minimal effect only was observed on wheat infected with Alternaria.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing is an important tool for mapping and monitoring vegetation. Advances in sensor technology continually improve the information content of imagery for airborne, as well as space-borne, systems. This paper investigates whether vegetation associations can be differentiated using hyperspectral reflectance in the visible to shortwave infrared spectral range, and how well species can be separated based on their spectra. For this purpose, the field reflectance spectra of 27 saltmarsh vegetation types of the Dutch Waddenzee wetland were analysed in three steps. Prior to analysis, the spectra were smoothed with an innovative wavelet approach.

In the first stage of the analysis, the reflectance spectra of the vegetation types were tested for differences between type classes. It was found that the reflectance spectra of saltmarsh vegetation types are statistically significantly different for various spectral regions.

Secondly, it was tested whether this statistical difference could be enhanced by using continuum removal as a normalisation technique. For vegetation spectra, continuum removal improves the statistical difference between vegetation types in the visible spectrum, but weakens the statistical difference of the spectra in the near-infrared and shortwave infrared part of the spectrum.

Thirdly, after statistical differences were found, it was determined how distant in spectral space the vegetation type classes were from each other, using the Bhattacharyya (BH) and the Jeffries–Matusita (JM) distance measures. We selected six wavelengths for this, based on the statistical analysis of the first step. The potential of correct classification of the saltmarsh vegetation types using hyperspectral remote sensing is predicted by these distance measures.

It is concluded that the reflectance of vegetation types is statistically different. With high quality radiometric calibration of hyperspectral imagery, it is anticipated that vegetation species may be identified from imagery using spectral libraries that were measured in the field during the time of image acquisition.},

	abstract = {The arcsine square root transformation has long been standard procedure when analyzing proportional data in ecology, with applications in data sets containing binomial and non-binomial response variables. Here, we argue that the arcsine transform should not be used in either circumstance. For binomial data, logistic regression has greater interpretability and higher power than analyses of transformed data. However, it is important to check the data for additional unexplained variation, i.e., overdispersion, and to account for it via the inclusion of random effects in the model if found. For non-binomial data, the arcsine transform is undesirable on the grounds of interpretability, and because it can produce nonsensical predictions. The logit transformation is proposed as an alternative approach to address these issues. Examples are presented in both cases to illustrate these advantages, comparing various methods of analyzing proportions including untransformed, arcsine- and logit-transformed linear models and logistic regression (with or without random effects). Simulations demonstrate that logistic regression usually provides a gain in power over other methods.},

The three methodologies employed used stepwise regression and either of the following: (i) standard first derivative reflectance spectra (FDS), (ii) absorption band depths, following continuum removal and normalisation against band depth at the centre of the absorption feature (BNC) or (iii) absorption band depths, following continuum removal and normalisation against the area of the absorption feature (BNA). These latter two methodologies have been proposed in this journal [Remote Sens. Environ., 67 (1999) 267.] on the basis of an experiment using reflectance spectra of dried and ground tree leaves and the concentration of three foliar biochemicals: nitrogen, lignin and cellulose. All three methodologies were implemented on a spectra/biochemical data set from early in the growing season and tested on a similar data set from late in the growing season. The accuracy with which foliar biochemical concentration could be estimated, while high for all methodologies, was highest when using the two proposed by Kokaly and Clark. At an illustrative R2 threshold of .85 (between estimated and observed biochemical concentration), all three methodologies could be used to estimate total chlorophyll, nitrogen, cellulose and sugar; in addition, the BNC methodology could be used to estimate chlorophyll a and b, and in addition to this, the BNA methodology could be used to estimate lignin and water. Given the advantages offered by the Kokaly and Clark methodologies (over and above the standard methodology) for a wide range of foliar biochemicals, it is recommended that their utility is investigated for the estimation of foliar biochemical concentration from field, airborne and spaceborne spectra.},

	abstract = {Summary
The goal of the study is to investigate the basic spectral properties of plant leaves to develop spectral indices more sensitive to chlorophyll concentration than the presently widely used Notmalized Difference Vegetation Index. These indices can serve as indicators of stress, senescence, and disease in higher plants. The spectral reflectance of senescing leaves of two deciduous species (maple and chestnut) as well as their pigment content were measured. Spectral indices were developed using reflectances corresponding to wavelengths with maximum and minimum sensitivity to variation in pigment concentration. The signature analysis of reflectance spectra indicated that, for a wide range of leaf greenness (completely yellow to dark green leaves), the maximum sensitivity of reflectance coincides with the maximum absorption of chlorophyll a at 670 nm. However, for yellow-green to green leaves (minimum chlorophyll a as low as 3-5 nmol/cm2), the reflectance near 670nm is not sensitive to chlorophyll concentration due to saturation effects. Therefore, it seems inappropriate to use this spectral band for pigment estimation in yellow-green to green vegetation. The spectral bands ranging from 400 to 480 nm and above 730 nm are not sensitive to chlorophyll concentration as found for 670 nm. The reflectances at these wavelengths could be used as references in the vegetation indices. Maximum sensitivity to chlorophyll a concentration was found at 550-560 nm and 700-710 nm. Reflectances at 700 nm correlated very well with that at 550 nm for a wide range of chlorophyll concentrations for both plant species studied. The inverse reflectance, R550)-1 and (R700)-1 are proportional to chlorophyll a concentration; therefore indices R750/R550 and R750/R700 are directly proportional (correlation r2 \&gt; 0.95) to chlorophyll concentration. These indices were tested for a wide range of chlorophyll a concentration, using several independent data sets. The estimation error in the derivation of chlorophyll concentration from the indices is assessed to be less than 1.2 nmol/cm2.},

The diffuse, Lambertian character of leaf reflectance emanates primarily from the interior of the leaf through multiple scattering, although there may be a small contribution of scattering from rough elements at the leaf surface. The specular and non-Lambertian character of leaf reflectance arises at the surface of the leaf. In this paper, the evolution of our current understanding of the mechanisms of leaf reflectance is reviewed. The use of measurements of polarized reflectance to separate leaf reflectance into diffuse and specular components is discussed. A section on the factors influencing leaf reflectance-leaf structure and physiological disturbances-is included along with discussion on the manner in which these influences are manifest.},

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the ratio of a vegetation index (VI) for estimating canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) and one for estimating leaf area index (LAI) can be used to derive chlorophyll content at the leaf level. This hypothesis for estimating chlorophyll content at the leaf level was tested using simulations with the PROSAIL radiative transfer model and field spectroradiometry measurements in five consecutive years (2010–2014) for potato crops on experimental fields. During the growing season, in-situ field measurements of LAI and leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) were performed. Results showed that good estimates of LCC were feasible using ratio vegetation indices (VIs). This was tested at satellite level using RapidEye images. This letter presents a proof of concept for estimating LCC using Sentinel-2 data. Results confirm the importance of the red-edge bands for agricultural applications, but also showed that indices using the red-edge bands may be replaced by indices using green bands. It should now be tested with real Sentinel-2 data whether its spectral bands at 10 m spatial resolution are suitable for estimating LCC, avoiding the need for red-edge bands that only are available at 20 m.},

	abstract = {Detection of plant water stress by remote sensing has been proposed using indices of Near-Infrared (NIR, 0.7–1.3 μm) and Middle-Infrared (MIR, 1.3–2.5 μm) wavelengths. The first objective of this study was to test the ability of the Leaf Water Content Index (LWCI) to determine leaf Relative Water content (RWC) of different species with different leaf morphologies. The second objective was to determine how the Moisture Stress Index (MSI; MIR / NIR) varies with RWC and the Equivalent Water Thickness (EWT). Reflectance factors at 0.82 μm and 1.6 μm were measured on leaves of Quercus agrifolia (sclerophyllous leaves), Liquidambar styraciflua (hardwood deciduous tree leaves), Picea rubens and Picea pungens (conifer needles), and Glycine max (herbaceous dicot leaves) as they dried on a laboratory bench. RWC and EWT were measured concurrently with the reflectance measurements. The results showed that LWCI was equal to RWC for the species tested. However, the results of a sensitivity analysis indicated the reflectances at 1.6 μm for two different RWC must be known for accurate prediction of unknown RWC; thus the LWCI is impractical for field applications. MSI was linearly correlated to RWCwith each species having a different regression equation and to log10 EWT with data of all species falling on the same regression line. Because EWT is correlated with leaf area index, MSI should also be correlated with leaf area index. Assuming that the linear regression equation of MSI to EWT can be applied to canopies, then the minimum significant change of RWC that can be detected is 52\%. For most plants, the natural variation in RWC from water stress is only about 20\%, so that we conclude that indices derived from NIR and MIR reflectances cannot be used to remotely-sense water stress.},

	abstract = {Because of the high water content of vegetation, water absorption features dominate spectral reflectance of vegetation in the near-infrared region of the spectrum. In comparison to indices based on chlorophyll absorption features (such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)), indices based on the water absorption bands are expected to “see” more deeply into thick canopies and have a preferential sensitivity to thin as opposed to thick tissues. These predictions are based on the much lower absorption coefficients for water in the short wavelength water bands as compared to chlorophyll. Thus, the water bands may have advantages over NDVI for remote sensing of photosynthetic tissues. Previous studies have primarily related water band indices (WI) to leaf area index (LAI). Here we expand the definition of photosynthetic tissues to include thin green stems and fruits and measure a wide range of species to determine the influence of variable tissue morphologies and canopy structures on these relationships. As expected, indices based on reflectance in the water absorption bands in the near infrared were best correlated with the water content of thin tissues (less than 0.5-cm thickness). The choice of wavelength for a water index was much more important for thick than for thin canopies, and the best wavelengths were those where water absorptance was weak to moderate. We identified three wavelength regions (950–970, 1150–1260 and 1520–1540 nm) that produced the best overall correlations with water content. Comparison of these wavelength regions with the atmospheric “windows” where water vapor absorption is minimal suggests that the 1150–1260 and 1520–1540 nm regions would be the best wavelengths for satellite remote sensing of water content. We also developed and tested a new Canopy Structure Index (CSI) that combines the low absorptance water bands with the simple ratio vegetation index (SR) to produce an index with a wider range of sensitivity to photosynthetic tissue area at all canopy thicknesses. CSI was better than either WI or SR alone for prediction of total area of photosynthetic tissues. However, SR was best for prediction of leaf area when other green tissues were excluded. All of these relationships showed good generality across a wide range of species and functional types.},

	abstract = {There is growing recognition that classifying terrestrial plant species on the basis of their function (into \&\#39;functional types\&\#39;) rather than their higher taxonomic identity, is a promising way forward for tackling important ecological questions at the scale of ecosystems, landscapes or biomes. These questions include those on vegetation responses to and vegetation effects on, environmental changes (e.g. changes in climate, atmospheric chemistry, land use or other disturbances). There is also growing consensus about a shortlist of plant traits that should underlie such functional plant classifications, because they have strong predictive power of important ecosystem responses to environmental change and/or they themselves have strong impacts on ecosystem processes. The most favoured traits are those that are also relatively easy and inexpensive to measure for large numbers of plant species. Large international research efforts, promoted by the IGBP\&\#8211;GCTE Programme, are underway to screen predominant plant species in various ecosystems and biomes worldwide for such traits. This paper provides an international methodological protocol aimed at standardising this research effort, based on consensus among a broad group of scientists in this field. It features a practical handbook with step-by-step recipes, with relatively brief information about the ecological context, for 28 functional traits recognised as critical for tackling large-scale ecological questions.},

	abstract = {1 If different factors inhibiting plant growth, e.g. low rainfall or low soil nutrients, were to select for species that have similar constellations of traits, then the unfavourable factors might usefully be grouped together as ‘stress’. 2 We offer a method for assessing this issue. A species mixture at a site is described by a point on a plane with two traits as axes. Change along an environmental gradient is then represented as a trajectory across the trait-plane. Trajectories along different environmental gradients are compared. 3 We measured leaf width, specific leaf area (SLA) and mature canopy height for the 386 perennial species found at 46 sites spread along rainfall and soil total phosphorus gradients in south-eastern Australia. Each trait was lognormally distributed across species within sites, hence the mean of log10(trait) satisfactorily described the species mixture at each site. 4 Combinations of assemblage-mean leaf width with SLA followed similar trajectories as rainfall and soil total P decreased. For these traits in this setting, the method indicated that low rainfall and low soil P favour similar trait-combinations. 5 Mature plant height also decreased along both rainfall and soil P gradients, and thus was positively correlated with leaf width and SLA at the level of assemblage means. The rainfall trajectories involving height behaved differently from the soil P trajectories, especially at rainfalls below c. 400 mm year−1, where assemblage-mean height declined much further than at low soil P. 6 Across all species, traits were only very loosely correlated (r2 from 0.04 to 0.17). For leaf width and SLA, evolutionary divergences were positively correlated, both before and after cross-correlation with divergence in rainfall and soil P was removed. This latter measures evolutionary divergence correlation within habitat. For height the picture was more complicated. Considering these within-habitat divergence correlations, species that were taller at maturity tended to have lower SLA and leaf width. This pattern is the reverse of the broad geographical correlation of assemblage means, showing that the patterns across assemblages result from species being selectively sifted from the regional flora into sites, not from evolutionary or cross-species correlations. 7 The trait-combination trajectory approach showed some commonalities between low soil nutrient and low rainfall habitats with regard to traits favoured in species occurring there, but also some differences. The approach has potential for clarifying which environmental factors can usefully be grouped together as ‘stress’, and which trait combinations can usefully be regarded as part of a syndrome favoured by stress.},

There exists no objective measure of coral health, so that individual perceptions of the paleness of an individual coral head, or an entire coral reef, are the foundation of coral bleaching reports. It is understood that coral bleaching results from an expulsion or reduction of the algae housed in the individual polyp, which causes the coral to lose its color. Satellite or airborne remote sensing may be a feasible means of mapping and monitoring coral reefs over large geographic areas if a quantitative means of remotely determining coral health can be developed. In an effort to remotely detect coral stress, in situ spectral reflectance of healthy and bleached Fijian scleractinian corals was measured with a hand-held spectroradiometer. Principal components and cluster analysis revealed that there is a spectral distinction between healthy and bleached coral based largely on magnitude of reflectance. Spectral derivative analysis was used to determine the specific wavelength regions ideal for remote identification of substrate type. These results are encouraging with respect to using an airborne spectroradiometer to identify areas of bleached corals thus enabling accurate monitoring over time.},

	abstract = {Precision agriculture dates back to the middle of the 1980's. Remote sensing applications in precision agriculture began with sensors for soil organic matter, and have quickly diversified to include satellite, aerial, and hand held or tractor mounted sensors. Wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation initially focused on a few key visible or near infrared bands. Today, electromagnetic wavelengths in use range from the ultraviolet to microwave portions of the spectrum, enabling advanced applications such as light detection and ranging (LiDAR), fluorescence spectroscopy, and thermal spectroscopy, along with more traditional applications in the visible and near infrared portions of the spectrum. Spectral bandwidth has decreased dramatically with the advent of hyperspectral remote sensing, allowing improved analysis of specific compounds, molecular interactions, crop stress, and crop biophysical or biochemical characteristics. A variety of spectral indices now exist for various precision agriculture applications, rather than a focus on only normalised difference vegetation indices. Spatial resolution of aerial and satellite remote sensing imagery has improved from 100's of m to sub-metre accuracy, allowing evaluation of soil and crop properties at fine spatial resolution at the expense of increased data storage and processing requirements. Temporal frequency of remote sensing imagery has also improved dramatically. At present there is considerable interest in collecting remote sensing data at multiple times in order to conduct near real time soil, crop and pest management.},

In this paper, the performance of the system is investigated and specific issues such as dark current correction or second order effects are addressed. Full width at half maximum was between 2.4 and 3.0 nm depending on the spectral band. The functional system was tested in flight at a 10-m altitude against a current field spectroscopy gold standard device Analytical Spectral Devices Field Spec 4 over an agricultural site. A highly significant correlation was found in reflection comparing both measurement approaches. Furthermore, the aerial measurements have a six times smaller standard deviation than the hand held measurements.

It is, therefore, necessary to monitor these changes in order to understand their impacts and to support management decisions that help ensuring sustainability. Remote sensing has proven to be a valuable tool for these purposes, and especially hyperspectral sensors are expected to provide valuable data for quantitative characterization of land change processes. In this study, simulated EnMAP data were used for mapping shrub cover fractions along a gradient of shrub encroachment, in a study region in southern Portugal. We compared three machine learning regression techniques: Support Vector Regression (SVR); Random Forest Regression (RF); and Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR). Additionally, we compared the influence of training sample size on the prediction performance. All techniques showed reasonably good results when trained with large samples, while SVR always outperformed the other algorithms. The best model was applied to produce a fractional shrub cover map for the whole study area. The predicted patterns revealed a gradient of shrub cover between regions affected by special agricultural management schemes for nature protection and areas without land use incentives. Our results highlight the value of EnMAP data in combination with machine learning regression techniques for monitoring gradual land change processes.},

This study developed and evaluated an object-based approach to understand what types of mangrove information can be mapped using different image datasets (Landsat TM, ALOS AVNIR-2, WorldView-2, and LiDAR). We compared and contrasted the ability of these images to map five levels of mangrove features, including vegetation boundary, mangrove stands, mangrove zonations, individual tree crowns, and species communities. We used the Moreton Bay site in Australia as the primary site to develop the classification rule sets and Karimunjawa Island in Indonesia to test the applicability of the rule sets. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of a conceptual hierarchical model for mapping specific mangrove features at discrete spatial scales. However, the rule sets developed in this study require modification to map similar mangrove features at different locations or when using image data acquired by different sensors. Across the hierarchical levels, smaller object sizes (i.e., tree crowns) required more complex classification rule sets. Incorporation of contextual information (e.g., distance and elevation) increased the overall mapping accuracy at the mangrove stand level (from 85\% to 94\%) and mangrove zonation level (from 53\% to 59\%). We found that higher image spatial resolution, larger object size, and fewer land-cover classes result in higher mapping accuracies. This study highlights the potential of selected images and mapping techniques to map mangrove features, and provides guidance for how to do this effectively through  multi-scale mangrove composition mapping.},

	abstract = {Coral reefs are in decline worldwide and monitoring activities are important for assessing the impact of disturbance on reefs and tracking subsequent recovery or decline. Monitoring by field surveys provides accurate data but at highly localised scales and so is not cost-effective for reef scale monitoring at frequent time points. Remote sensing from satellites is an alternative and complementary approach. While remote sensing cannot provide the level of detail and accuracy at a single point than a field survey, the statistical power for inferring large scale patterns benefits in having complete areal coverage. This review considers the state of the art of coral reef remote sensing for the diverse range of objectives relevant for management, ranging from the composition of the reef: physical extent, benthic cover, bathymetry, rugosity; to environmental parameters: sea surface temperature, exposure, light, carbonate chemistry. In addition to updating previous reviews, here we also consider the capability to go beyond basic maps of habitats or environmental variables, to discuss concepts highly relevant to stakeholders, policy makers and public communication: such as biodiversity, environmental threat and ecosystem services. A clear conclusion of the review is that advances in both sensor technology and processing algorithms continue to drive forward remote sensing capability for coral reef mapping, particularly with respect to spatial resolution of maps, and synthesis across multiple data products. Both trends can be expected to continue.},

	abstract = {Past laboratory and field studies have quantified phenolic substances in vegetative matter from reflectance measurements for understanding plant response to herbivores and insect predation. Past remote sensing studies on phenolics have evaluated crop quality and vegetation patterns caused by bedrock geology and associated variations in soil geochemistry. We examined spectra of pure phenolic compounds, common plant biochemical constituents, dry leaves, fresh leaves, and plant canopies for direct evidence of absorption features attributable to plant phenolics. Using spectral feature analysis with continuum removal, we observed that a narrow feature at 1.66 μm is persistent in spectra of manzanita, sumac, red maple, sugar maple, tea, and other species. This feature was consistent with absorption caused by aromatic CH bonds in the chemical structure of phenolic compounds and non-hydroxylated aromatics. Because of overlapping absorption by water, the feature was weaker in fresh leaf and canopy spectra compared to dry leaf measurements. Simple linear regressions of feature depth and feature area with polyphenol concentration in tea resulted in high correlations and low errors (\% phenol by dry weight) at the dry leaf (r2 = 0.95, RMSE = 1.0\%, n = 56), fresh leaf (r2 = 0.79, RMSE = 2.1\%, n = 56), and canopy (r2 = 0.78, RMSE = 1.0\%, n = 13) levels of measurement. Spectra of leaves, needles, and canopies of big sagebrush and evergreens exhibited a weak absorption feature centered near 1.63 μm, short ward of the phenolic compounds, possibly consistent with terpenes. This study demonstrates that subtle variation in vegetation spectra in the shortwave infrared can directly indicate biochemical constituents and be used to quantify them. Phenolics are of lesser abundance compared to the major plant constituents but, nonetheless, have important plant functions and ecological significance. Additional research is needed to advance our understanding of the spectral influences of plant phenolics and terpenes relative to dominant leaf biochemistry (water, chlorophyll, protein/nitrogen, cellulose, and lignin).},

	abstract = {Detection of yellow rust is of great importance in disease control and reducing the use of fungicide. Spectral analysis is an important method for disease detection in terms of remote sensing. In this study, an emerging spectral analysis method known as continuous wavelet analysis (CWA) was examined and compared with several conventional spectral features for the detection of yellow rust disease at a leaf level. The leaf spectral measurements were made by a spectroradiometer at both Zodaks 37 and 70 stages with a large sample size. The results showed that the wavelet features were able to capture the major spectral signatures of yellow rust, and exhibited considerable potential for disease detection at both growth stages. Both the accuracies of the univariate and multivariate models suggested that wavelet features outperformed conventional spectral features in quantifying disease severity at leaf level. Optimal accuracies returned a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.81 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.110 for pooled data at both stages. Furthermore, wavelet features showed a stronger response to the yellow rust at Zodaks 70 stage than at Zodaks 37 stage, indicating reliable estimation of disease severity can be made until the Zodaks 70 stage.},

	abstract = {1. Essential Biodiversity Variable, Natural Capital, Biodiversity Indicator and Ecosystem Service are four concepts that underpin the most popular frameworks currently considered for helping to coordinate and structure biodiversity monitoring efforts worldwide. Satellite Remote Sensing (SRS) has considerable potential to inform these initiatives. To date, however, discussions on the role of SRS in supporting these frameworks have mostly evolved independently; tend to be led by different groups; sometimes target slightly different scales; and are likely to reach different audiences. Because of this, there is some confusion among environmental managers and policymakers as to what the potential of SRS is or whether there is prospect in considering and promoting the use of satellite data for biodiversity conservation. 2. Here, we provide a brief overview of the role of SRS to date in informing these frameworks. Through a case study focused on the Sahara Desert ecosystem, we also demonstrate the current potential for SRS-based methodologies to support conservation in data-deficient areas and discuss the relative applicability of SRS-based metrics to each of these frameworks. 3. The relevance and use of SRS across the four frameworks are clearly variable, due to differences and ambiguity in definitions, and due to differences in monitoring priorities. Our case study illustrates the particularly high potential for SRS approaches to provide key information relevant to the Biodiversity Indicators framework in desert ecosystems; it also identifies SRS-based metrics relevant to all frameworks. 4. Altogether, this work highlights how more dialogue is required within the biodiversity-monitoring community for SRS to reach its full potential in conservation. In particular, agreement on what is needed in priority, given the realm of what is possible, will be of paramount importance to developing SRS-based products that are used by policymakers and international conventions.},

It explores applications of statistical signal processing to hyperspectral imaging and further develops non-literal (spectral) techniques for subpixel detection and mixed pixel classification. This text is the first of its kind on the topic and can be considered a recipe book offering various techniques for hyperspectral data exploitation. In particular, some known techniques, such as OSP (Orthogonal Subspace Projection) and CEM (Constrained Energy Minimization) that were previously developed in the RSSIPL, are discussed in great detail. This book is self-contained and can serve as a valuable and useful reference for researchers in academia and practitioners in government and industry.},

	abstract = {Puccinia psidii is a major threat to members of the Myrtaceae worldwide. New Zealand is still free of P. psidii but possesses significant Eucalyptus plantations as well as valuable native tree species such as Metrosideros excelsa and Leptospermum scoparium that could be at risk in the event of an incursion. As part of preparing for a potential incursion, we generated a barcode reference library for {\textgreater}100 diverse species of Myrtaceae occurring in New Zealand by sequencing internal transcribed spacer (ITS), external transcribed spacer (ETS) and maturase K (matK), or by obtaining relevant sequences from GenBank. The Myrtaceae DNA barcoding database will enable rapid identification of large numbers of host species in the event of a myrtle rust incursion. We undertook a comparative analysis of the ability for the three mentioned loci to discriminate species. Interspecific divergence was assessed by mean interspecific distance, θ prime and minimum interspecific distance; intraspecific variation was evaluated by mean intraspecific difference, θ and coalescent depth. Overall identification efficiency of the three loci sequenced was determined using BLAST1 and Near Distance methods. Barcoding gaps between inter- and intraspecific divergences were also analysed. ITS and ETS share similar mean interspecific distance, θ prime and minimum interspecific distance values – both higher than obtained for matK. In contrast, in terms of intraspecific variation, matK had higher values than ITS and ETS in all three metrics analysed. ITS had the highest identification success rate for species followed by matK and ETS, respectively, as measured by BLAST1 and Near Distance methods. Overall identification success rate increases when a combination of ITS and matK in particular is used. The sequence data are not only a valuable reference collection for a myrtle rust response but also a national botanical resource.},

The causal organism, identified by Miss Wakefield as Puccinia psidii, is a common parasite of the rose apple [Eugenia makiccensis]. and as this host was observed for several years to be severely affected in close proximity to healthy pimento, the pimento strain is almost certainly a very recent mutation of the other.
The disease attacks only the young tissues, causing early defoliation, death of the young twigs, and shedding of the flowers and young berries, with consequent reduction of yield; it has not so far proved fatal.
Spraying is considered impracticable because of the wide area affected, the necessity of making frequent applications to protect the young growth, and the fact that nearly all the trees are wild, none growing under plantation conditions where direct methods of control are economically advantageous. Though the damage already caused, especially in some districts, has been very severe, it is thought that the losses sustained will not be so serious with the return of normal weather.},

	abstract = {Small unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) provide an economical means of imaging large areas of terrain at far lower cost than satellites. Applications range from precision agriculture to disaster response and power line maintenance. Because small UAVs fly at low altitudes of approximately 100 meters, their cameras have only a limited field of view and must take thousands of photographs to cover a reasonably sized area. To provide a unified view of the area, these photographs must be combined into a seamless photo mosaic. The conventional approach for accomplishing this mosaicking process is called block bundle adjustment, and it works well if there are only a few tens or hundreds of photographs. It runs in O(n3) time, where n is the number of images. When there are thousands of photographs, this method fails because its memory and computational time requirements become prohibitively excessive. We have developed a new technique that replaces bundle adjustment with an iterative algorithm that is very fast and requires little memory. After pairwise image registration, the algorithm projects the resulting tie points to the ground and moves them closer to each other to produce a new set of control points. It fits the image parameters to these control points and repeats the process iteratively to convergence. The algorithm is implemented as an image mosaicking application in Java and runs on a Windows PC. It executes in O(n) time and produces very high resolution mosaics (2 cm per pixel) at the rate of 14 sec per image. This time includes all steps of the mosaicking process from the disk read of the imagery to the disk output of the final mosaic. Experiments show the algorithm to be accurate and reliable for mosaicking thousands of images.},

However, LAI is difficult to directly acquire for large spatial extents due to its time consuming and work intensive nature. Such efforts have been significantly improved by the emergence of optical and active remote sensing techniques. This paper reviews the definitions and theories of LAI measurement with respect to direct and indirect methods. Then, the methodologies for LAI retrieval with regard to the characteristics of a range of remotely sensed datasets are discussed. Remote sensing indirect methods are subdivided into two categories of passive and active remote sensing, which are further categorized as terrestrial, aerial and satellite-born platforms. Due to a wide variety in spatial resolution of remotely sensed data and the requirements of ecological modeling, the scaling issue of LAI is discussed and special consideration is given to extrapolation of measurement to landscape and regional levels.},

* We analyzed and compared multiple canopy foliar trait distributions using field sampling and airborne imaging spectroscopy along an Andes-to-Amazon elevation gradient. Field-estimated traits were generated from three community-weighting methods, and remotely sensed estimates of traits were made at three scales defined by sampling grain size and ecological extent.


* Field and remote sensing approaches revealed increases in average leaf mass per unit area (LMA), water, nonstructural carbohydrates (NSCs) and polyphenols with increasing elevation. Foliar nutrients and photosynthetic pigments displayed little to no elevation trend. Sample weighting approaches had little impact on field-estimated trait responses to elevation. Plot representativeness of trait distributions at landscape scales decreased with increasing elevation. Remote sensing indicated elevation-dependent increases in trait variance and distributional skew.

	abstract = {Two critical limitations for using current satellite sensors in real-time crop management are the lack of imagery with optimum spatial and spectral resolutions and an unfavorable revisit time for most crop stress-detection applications. Alternatives based on manned airborne platforms are lacking due to their high operational costs. A fundamental requirement for providing useful remote sensing products in agriculture is the capacity to combine high spatial resolution and quick turnaround times. Remote sensing sensors placed on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) could fill this gap, providing low-cost approaches to meet the critical requirements of spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions. This paper demonstrates the ability to generate quantitative remote sensing products by means of a helicopter-based UAV equipped with inexpensive thermal and narrowband multispectral imaging sensors. During summer of 2007, the platform was flown over agricultural fields, obtaining thermal imagery in the 7.5-13-mum region (40-cm resolution) and narrowband multispectral imagery in the 400-800-nm spectral region (20-cm resolution). Surface reflectance and temperature imagery were obtained, after atmospheric corrections with MODTRAN. Biophysical parameters were estimated using vegetation indices, namely, normalized difference vegetation index, transformed chlorophyll absorption in reflectance index/optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index, and photochemical reflectance index (PRI), coupled with SAILH and FLIGHT models. As a result, the image products of leaf area index, chlorophyll content (C ab), and water stress detection from PRI index and canopy temperature were produced and successfully validated. This paper demonstrates that results obtained with a low-cost UAV system for agricultural applications yielded comparable estimations, if not better, than those obtained by traditional manned airborne sensors.},

	abstract = {In September 2002, NASA’s solar-powered Pathfinder-Plus unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was used to conduct a proof-of-concept mission in US national airspace above the 1500 ha plantation of the Kauai Coffee Company in Hawaii. While in national airspace, the transponder-equipped UAV was supervised by regional air traffic controllers and treated like a conventionally piloted aircraft. High resolution color and multispectral imaging payloads, both drawing from the aircraft’s solar power system, were housed in exterior-mounted environmental pressure pods. A local area network (LAN) using unlicensed radio frequency was used for camera control and downlink of image data at rates exceeding 5 Mbit s−1. A wide area network (WAN) allowed a project investigator stationed on the US mainland to uplink control commands during part of the mission. Images were available for enhancing, printing, and interpretation within minutes of collection. The color images were useful for mapping invasive weed outbreaks and for revealing irrigation and fertilization anomalies. Multispectral imagery was related to mature fruit harvest from certain fields with significant fruit display on the tree canopy exterior. During 4 h “loitering” above the plantation, ground-based pilots were able to precisely navigate the UAV along pre-planned flightlines, and also perform spontaneous maneuvers under the direction of the project scientist for image collection in cloud-free zones. Despite the presence of ground-obscuring cumulus cloud cover of ca. 70\% during the image collection period, the UAV’s maneuvering capability ultimately enabled collection of cloud-free imagery throughout most of the plantation. The mission demonstrated the capability of a slow-flying UAV, equipped with downsized imaging systems and line-of-sight telemetry, to monitor a localized agricultural region for an extended time period. The authors suggest that evolving long-duration (weeks to months) UAVs stand to make a valuable future contribution to regional agricultural resource monitoring.},

	abstract = {Hyperspectral remote sensing serves as an effective tool for estimating foliar nitrogen using a variety of techniques. Vegetation indices (VIs) are a simple means of retrieving foliar nitrogen. Despite their popularity, few studies have been conducted to examine the utility of VIs for mapping canopy foliar nitrogen in a mixed forest context. In this study, we assessed the performance of 32 vegetation indices derived from HySpex airborne hyperspectral images for estimating canopy mass-based foliar nitrogen concentration (\%N) in the Bavarian Forest National Park. The partial least squares regression (PLSR) was performed for comparison. These vegetation indices were classified into three categories that are mostly correlated to nitrogen, chlorophyll, and structural properties such as leaf area index (LAI). \%N was destructively measured in 26 broadleaf, needle leaf, and mixed stand plots to represent the different species and canopy structure. The canopy foliar \%N is defined as the plot-level mean foliar \%N of all species weighted by species canopy foliar mass fraction. Our results showed that the variance of canopy foliar \%N is mainly explained by functional type and species composition. The normalized difference nitrogen index (NDNI) produced the most accurate estimation of \%N (R2CV = 0.79, RMSECV = 0.26). A comparable estimation of \%N was obtained by the chlorophyll index Boochs2 (R2CV = 0.76, RMSECV = 0.27). In addition, the mean NIR reflectance (800–850 nm), representing canopy structural properties, also achieved a good accuracy in \%N estimation (R2CV = 0.73, RMSECV = 0.30). The PLSR model provided a less accurate estimation of \%N (R2CV = 0.69, RMSECV = 0.32). We argue that the good performance of all three categories of vegetation indices in \%N estimation can be attributed to the synergy among plant traits (i.e., canopy structure, leaf chemical and optical properties) while these traits may converge across plant species for evolutionary reasons. Our findings demonstrated the feasibility of using hyperspectral vegetation indices to estimate \%N in a mixed temperate forest which may relate to the effect of the physical basis of nitrogen absorption features on canopy reflectance, or the biological links between nitrogen, chlorophyll, and canopy structure.},

Pollination is an ecosystem function that varies at local spatial scales. Remote sensing may help to quantify and map the resulting patterns for a better understanding of ecosystem functioning. This task is challenging because the signal measured by sensors is dominated by leaf and canopy optical traits that determine the vegetation spectrum. No direct influence of pollination types (i.e. wind, insect and self-pollination) can be expected. We thus ask: (1) how strongly are pollination types at the community level linked with optical traits; and (2) do these links allow us to map spatial patterns of pollination types with remote sensing data?


Location

Mires and Molinia grasslands in Bavaria, southern Germany.


Methods

We sampled vascular plant species composition, as well as traits related to optical spectral signals, for 100 plots. Information on pollination types and additional optical traits were compiled from established plant trait databases. Simultaneously with the field sampling, image data of the study site were acquired using the airborne sensor AISA Dual. We tested for correlations between pollination types and optical traits. Based on these results, we regressed the plot-based information on pollination types against the corresponding spectral signal extracted from the image data. We inverted the models using the image in order to obtain maps of the pollination type distribution across the study site.


Results

In our study site, pollination types and optical traits were significantly correlated, up to R = −0.813 in the case of wind pollination and leaf dry matter content. These relations are, however, not necessarily transferable to other ecosystems, phenological stages and spatial scales, and their physical interpretation requires careful consideration. We were able to statistically model the spatial distribution of pollination types with a RMSE {\textless} 10.5\%. The resulting maps provide detailed insights into the spatial distribution of pollination types at the community level.


Conclusions

The results show that pollination types are indeed related to canopy reflectance in a way that allows their mapping using remote sensing. More research is needed in order to improve our knowledge about transferable relations between pollination types and plant traits in other ecosystems and at different phenological stages.},

Vegetation state monitoring has been identified by the South African Mission Advisory Committee (EO – MAC) as the primary objective of the proposed EO-SAT1 satellite to be launched in the near future. The paper provides a review of the developments in the science of satellite remote sensing as it quantifies the studies that have been done, using specific sensors and evaluates the importance of sensor resolution and data availability for South Africa. Specific application examples are used to showcase the developments. An analysis of studies shows that South African scientists have used a wide range of satellite data and developed novel processing techniques with applications specific to the environmental conditions of the region. However, this work has observed that, for accurate and reliable vegetation monitoring at a national scale, access to relatively cheap satellite data with optimal spectral band information is limited.},

	abstract = {The ratio of leaf area to ground area (leaf area index, LAI) is an important state variable in ecosystem studies since it influences fluxes of matter and energy between the land surface and the atmosphere. As a basis for generating temporally continuous and spatially distributed datasets of LAI, the current study contributes an analysis of its spatial variability and spatial structure. Soil-vegetation-atmosphere fluxes of water, carbon and energy are nonlinearly related to LAI. Therefore, its spatial heterogeneity, i.e., the combination of spatial variability and structure, has an effect on simulations of these fluxes. To assess LAI spatial heterogeneity, we apply a Comprehensive Data Analysis Approach that combines data from remote sensing (5 m resolution) and simulation (150 m resolution) with field measurements and a detailed land use map. Test area is the arable land in the fertile loess plain of the Rur catchment on the Germany-Belgium-Netherlands border. LAI from remote sensing and simulation compares well with field measurements. Based on the simulation results, we describe characteristic crop-specific temporal patterns of LAI spatial variability. By means of these patterns, we explain the complex multimodal frequency distributions of LAI in the remote sensing data. In the test area, variability between agricultural fields is higher than within fields. Therefore, spatial resolutions less than the 5 m of the remote sensing scenes are sufficient to infer LAI spatial variability. Frequency distributions from the simulation agree better with the multimodal distributions from remote sensing than normal distributions do. The spatial structure of LAI in the test area is dominated by a short distance referring to field sizes. Longer distances that refer to soil and weather can only be derived from remote sensing data. Therefore, simulations alone are not sufficient to characterize LAI spatial structure. It can be concluded that a comprehensive picture of LAI spatial heterogeneity and its temporal course can contribute to the development of an approach to create spatially distributed and temporally continuous datasets of LAI.},

Four infection levels in rice panicles were used in the study: no infection condition, light and moderate infection caused by rice glume blight disease, and serious infection caused by rice false smut disease. Hyperspectral reflectance of rice panicles was measured through the wavelength range from 350 to 2500 nm with a portable spectroradiometer in the laboratory. The spectral response characteristics of rice panicles were analyzed, and principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to obtain the principal components (PCs) derived from different spectra processing methods, namely raw, inverse logarithmic, first, and second derivative reflectance. A learning vector quantization (LVQ) neural network classifier was employed to classify healthy, light, moderate, and serious infection levels. Classification accuracy was evaluated using overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient. The overall accuracies of LVQ with PCA derived from the raw, inverse logarithmic, first, and second derivative reflectance spectra for the validation dataset were 91.6\%, 86.4\%, 95.5\%, and 100\% respectively, and the corresponding Kappa coefficients were 0.887, 0.818, 0.939 and 1.

We want to contribute to the understanding of the causes for plant spectrum variability at leaf and community levels.
Methods We measured leaf reflectance spectra (300–887nm) of representative plant species from different habitats and analyzed spectral differences among species groups. To explain leaf spectra variability within a group, we performed detailed analyses of leaf morphological and biochemical traits in selected species.
Important Findings The reflectance spectra of the different species groups differed most in the green, yellow and red spectral ranges. The reflectance spectra of submerged leaves of hydrophytes with simple structures were explained by their biochemical traits (carotenoids), while for more complex aerial leaves, morphological traits were more important. In submerged and natant leaves of amphiphytes, total mesophyll and spongy tissue thickness were the most important traits, and these explained 44\% and 47\%, respectively, of the spectrum variability of each plant group. In general, the redundancy analysis biplots show that samples of different plant species colonizing the same habitat form separate clusters and are related to the explanatory variables in different ways. The redundancy analysis biplots of helophytes and wet meadow species show clustering of graminoids and dicots into two distinct groups. Leaf encrustation (prickle hair properties and epidermis thickness) is important for graminoids, while leaf thickness and specific leaf area have more important roles in dicots. Our results show that knowledge of the species composition and leaf traits is necessary to interpret the reflectance spectra of such plant communities.},

	abstract = {Our ability to measure and map plant function at multiple ecological scales is critical for understanding current and future changes in Earth's ecosystems and the global carbon budget. Conventional plant functional types (cPFTs) based on a few productivity-related traits have been previously used to simplify and represent major differences in global plant functions, but more recent research has directly focused on the use of functional trait information. Still, sampling limitations have constrained efforts to truly understand the variance and covariance of functional traits globally. Reflectance spectra offer a fast, repeatable, simultaneous measurement of a wide variety of leaf functional traits and could be used to optically define leaf functional types. To evaluate this concept, we measured leaf reflectance from a wide range of species in a diverse set of ecosystems across central and northern California, including observations from multiple individuals, sites, and seasons. Using principal components analysis, we analyzed spectral variation in relation to categorical attributes such as species and cPFTs, as well as to a set of functional trait metrics calculated from the spectra. We found the first three principal components (PCs) to be weakly related to categorical attributes and more strongly related to spectrally-derived functional metrics. Each PC was more strongly associated with different portions of the spectrum and contained different functional information. We applied a hybrid clustering algorithm to the PC coordinates of the observations to define potential optical leaf functional types. Twelve spectral clusters were identified, and these did not correspond directly to either single cPFTs or species. However, each cluster had a unique functional metric profile. Clusters represented both inter- and intra-species and cPFT functional differences driven by taxonomy, trait evolution and environmental responses, demonstrating their value as optical leaf functional types and the value of the clustering approach used here for defining optical types from leaf spectra. Our findings support the notion that cPFTs do not adequately capture differences in leaf function. They demonstrate that spectral measurements can be used to improve both the definition of PFTs as well as our knowledge regarding the covariance of functional traits within these classes.},

	abstract = {The aim of this research is the early detection of plant diseases based on the combination of vegetation indices. We have seen that an individual index such as the most popular one, namely NDVI, does not discriminate adequately between healthy and diseased plants, e.g. Cercospora beticola, Erysiphe betae, and Uromyces betae. However, by combining vegetation indices, which are usually called features in classification, very reliable results can be achieved. We use Support Vector Machines for classification. By this we receive a classification accuracy of almost 95\% for Cercospora beticola and Uromyces betae and still over 92\% for Erysiphe betae. Depending on the different plant diseases we have found that different vegetation indices are important, too. Consequently, the question how to find the best index for every plant disease and the choice of the best subset arise. Both questions are not the same, because different indices contain similar information which can already be seen from the formula of the calculation of the vegetation index. These dependencies do not have to be linear. In order to identify optimal subsets of features for the different pathogens already at an early stage of infestation, we have found that entropy and mutual information are adequate concepts. Accordingly we use the minimum redundancy - maximum relevance (mRMR) criterion to evaluate the features. We have found that we need different indices and feature subsets of different sizes for different diseases.},

	abstract = {A field spectroscopy metadata standard is defined as those data elements that explicitly document the spectroscopy dataset and field protocols, sampling strategies, instrument properties and environmental and logistical variables. Standards for field spectroscopy metadata affect the quality, completeness, reliability, and usability of datasets created in situ. Currently there is no standardized methodology for documentation of in situ spectroscopy data or metadata. This paper presents results of an international experiment comprising a web-based survey and expert panel evaluation that investigated critical metadata in field spectroscopy. The survey participants were a diverse group of scientists experienced in gathering spectroscopy data across a wide range of disciplines. Overall, respondents were in agreement about a core metadataset for generic campaign metadata, allowing for a prioritization of critical metadata elements to be proposed including  those relating to viewing geometry, location, general target and sampling properties, illumination, instrument properties, reference standards, calibration, hyperspectral signal properties, atmospheric conditions, and general project details. Consensus was greatest among individual expert groups in specific application domains. The results allow the identification of a core set of metadata fields that enforce long term data storage and serve as a foundation for a metadata standard. This paper is part one in a series about the core elements of a robust and flexible field spectroscopy metadata standard.},

We summarize research on behavioral responses of wildlife to UAS, and discuss the need to understand how recreational and commercial applications of this technology could disturb certain species. Currently, the widespread implementation of UAS by scientists is limited by flight range, regulatory frameworks, and a lack of validation. UAS are most effective when used to examine smaller areas close to their launch sites, whereas manned aircraft are recommended for surveying greater distances. The growing demand for UAS in research and industry is driving rapid regulatory and technological progress, which in turn will make them more accessible and effective as analytical tools.},

Wavelets are functions that satisfy certain mathematical requirements and are used in representing data or other functions. Most of the basic wavelet theory has now been done. The mathematics have been worked out in excruciating detail, and wavelet theory is now in the refinement stage. This involves generalizing and extending wavelets, such as in extending wavelet packet techniques. The future of wavelets lies in the as-yet uncharted territory of applications.

Recent advances in materials and optics have allowed the development of smaller, more stable, accurately calibrated imaging spectrometers that can quantify biophysical properties on the basis of the spectral absorbing and scattering characteristics of the land surface. Airborne and spaceborne imaging spectrometers, which measure large numbers (hundreds) of narrow spectral bands, are becoming more widely available from government and commercial sources; thus, it is increasingly feasible to use data from imaging spectroscopy for environmental research. In contrast to multispectral sensors, imaging spectroscopy produces quantitative estimates of biophysical absorptions, which can be used to improve scientific understanding of ecosystem functioning and properties. We present the recent advances in imaging spectroscopy and new capabilities for using it to quantify a range of ecological variables.},

Remote sensing of quantitative biochemical and biophysical characteristics of small-sized spatially fragmented vegetation canopies requires, however, not only high spatial, but also high spectral (i.e., hyperspectral) resolution. In this paper, we describe the design, development, airborne operations, calibration, processing, and interpretation of image data collected with a new hyperspectral unmanned aircraft system (HyperUAS). HyperUAS is a remotely controlled multirotor prototype carrying onboard a lightweight pushbroom spectroradiometer coupled with a dual frequency GPS and an inertial movement unit. The prototype was built to remotely acquire imaging spectroscopy data of 324 spectral bands (162 bands in a spectrally binned mode) with bandwidths between 4 and 5 nm at an ultrahigh spatial resolution of 2–5 cm. Three field airborne experiments, conducted over agricultural crops and over natural ecosystems of Antarctic mosses, proved operability of the system in standard field conditions, but also in a remote and harsh, low-temperature environment of East Antarctica. Experimental results demonstrate that HyperUAS is capable of delivering georeferenced maps of quantitative biochemical and biophysical variables of vegetation and of actual vegetation health state at an unprecedented spatial resolution of 5 cm.},

In Australia, dugongs ( Dugong dugon ) are regularly surveyed and long-term datasets have formed the basis for defining habitat of high conservation value and risk assessments of human impacts. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) may facilitate more accurate, human-risk free, and cheaper aerial surveys. We undertook the first Australian UAV survey trial in Shark Bay, western Australia. We conducted seven flights of the  ScanEagle  UAV, mounted with a digital SLR camera payload. During each flight, ten transects covering a 1.3 km 2  area frequently used by dugongs, were flown at 500, 750 and 1000 ft. Image (photograph) capture was controlled via the Ground Control Station and the capture rate was scheduled to achieve a prescribed 10\% overlap between images along transect lines. Images were manually reviewed  post hoc  for animals and scored according to sun glitter, Beaufort Sea state and turbidity. We captured 6243 images, 627 containing dugongs. We also identified whales, dolphins, turtles and a range of other fauna. Of all possible dugong sightings, 95\% (CI = 90\%, 98\%) were subjectively classed as ‘certain’ (unmistakably dugongs). Neither our dugong sighting rate, nor our ability to identify dugongs with certainty, were affected by UAV altitude. Turbidity was the only environmental variable significantly affecting the dugong sighting rate. Our results suggest that UAV systems may not be limited by sea state conditions in the same manner as sightings from manned surveys. The overlap between images proved valuable for detecting animals that were masked by sun glitter in the corners of images, and identifying animals initially captured at awkward body angles. This initial trial of a basic camera system has successfully demonstrated that the  ScanEagle  UAV has great potential as a tool for marine mammal aerial surveys.},

However, land-use change leading to environmental homogenization is a major cause for the dramatic decline of biodiversity under global change. The difficulty in assessing large-scale biodiversity losses urgently requires new technological advances to evaluate land-use impact on diversity timely and efficiently across space. 2. While cost-effective aerial images have been suggested for potential biodiversity assessments in forests, correlation of canopy object variables such as gaps with plant or animal diversity has so far not been demonstrated using these images. 3. Here, we show that aerial images of canopy gaps can be used to assess floristic biodiversity of the forest understorey. This approach is made possible because we employed cutting-edge unmanned aerial vehicles and very high-resolution images (7 cm pixel−1) of the canopy properties. We demonstrate that detailed, spatially implicit information on gap shape metrics is sufficient to reveal strong dependency between disturbance patterns and plant diversity (R2 up to 0·74). This is feasible because opposing disturbance patterns such as aggregated and dispersed tree retention directly correspond to different functional and dispersal traits of species and ultimately to different species diversities. 4. Our findings can be used as a coarse-filter approach to conservation in forests wherever light strongly limits regeneration and biodiversity.},

Two new indices (PSSR and PSND) are developed which have advantages over previous techniques. The optimal individual wavebands for pigment estimation are identified empirically as 680nm for chlorophyll a, 635nm for chlorophyll b and 470nm for the carotenoids. These wavebands are justified theoretically and are shown to improve the performance of many of the spectral indices tested. Strong predictive models are demonstrated for chlorophyll a and b, but not for the carotenoids and the paper explores the reasons for this.},

To improve the classification performance, efficient feature extraction methods are needed. This paper introduces a set of features based on the discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Wavelet coefficients, wavelet energies and wavelet detail histogram features are employed as new features for classification. As a feature reduction procedure, we propose a sequential floating search method. Selection is performed using a cost function based on the estimated probability of error, using the Fisher criterion. This procedure selects the best combination of features. To demonstrate the proposed wavelet features and selection procedure, we apply it to vegetation stress detection. For this application, it is shown that wavelet coefficients outperform spectral reflectance and that the proposed selection procedure outperforms combining the best single features.},

	abstract = {Abstract.  Ecologists need a common language of plant traits in order to make comparisons across regions and scales, pool data, and maximize the utility of the data. To develop such a set of traits we began with the primary challenges faced by plants: dispersal, establishment, and persistence in order to identify fundamental traits. Most of these traits are hard to measure, but advances in comparative ecology have suggested a number of easy to measure analogs. Unfortunately, some of the fundamental traits have no simple analog. The common core list includes: seed mass, seed shape, dispersal mode, clonality, specific leaf area, leaf water content, height, above-ground biomass, life history, onset of flowering, stem density, and resprouting ability. Most of the traits can be measured quantitatively, but several traits on the list must still be measured qualitatively due to logistical problems or lack of an easy analog. Key problem areas include: dispersal ability, capacity for vegetative spread, germination, palatability, plasticity, and all the various below-ground traits. Comparative studies need to address these problem areas. The common core list is suggested as a common starting point for studies of functional ecology. The idiosyncrasies of regional floras and specific research agendas will dictate which traits can be ignored and those that need to be added.},

The LMA can be broken down into the leaf density (LD) and leaf volume to area ratio (LVA or thickness), which in turn are determined by anatomical tissues and chemical composition. The aim of this study is to understand the anatomical and chemical characteristics related to LMA variation in species growing in the field along a water availability gradient. We determined LMA and its components (LD, LVA and anatomical tissues) for 34 Mediterranean (20 evergreen and 14 deciduous) woody species. Variation in LMA was due to variation in both LD and LVA. For both deciduous and evergreen species LVA variation was strongly and positively related with mesophyll volume per area (VA or thickness), but for evergreen species positive relationships of LVA with the VA of epidermis, vascular plus sclerenchyma tissues and air spaces were found as well. The leaf carbon concentration was positively related with mesophyll VA in deciduous species, and with VA of vascular plus sclerenchymatic tissues in evergreens. Species occurring at the sites with lower water availability were generally characterised by a high LMA and LD.},

Comparing absorption spectra of Anth-containing and Anth-free leaves with the same chlorophyll (Chl) content, absorption spectra of Anth in leaves were derived. The main spectral feature of Anth absorption in vivo was a peak around 550 nm; the peak magnitude was closely related to Anth content. A quantitative nondestructive technique was developed to subtract Chl contribution to reflectance in this spectral region and retrieve Anth content from reflectance over a wide range of pigment content and composition. Anth reflectance index in the form ARI = (R550)−1− (R700)−1, where (R550)−1 and (R700)−1 are inverse reflectances at 550 and 700 nm, respectively, allowed an accurate estimation of Anth accumulation, even in minute amounts, in intact senescing and stressed leaves.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated the usefulness of optical indices from hyperspectral remote sensing in the assessment of vegetation biophysical variables both in forestry and agriculture. Those indices are, however, the combined response to variations of several vegetation and environmental properties, such as Leaf Area Index (LAI), leaf chlorophyll content, canopy shadows, and background soil reflectance. Of particular significance to precision agriculture is chlorophyll content, an indicator of photosynthesis activity, which is related to the nitrogen concentration in green vegetation and serves as a measure of the crop response to nitrogen application. This paper presents a combined modeling and indices-based approach to predicting the crop chlorophyll content from remote sensing data while minimizing LAI (vegetation parameter) influence and underlying soil (background) effects. This combined method has been developed first using simulated data and followed by evaluation in terms of quantitative predictive capability using real hyperspectral airborne data. Simulations consisted of leaf and canopy reflectance modeling with PROSPECT and SAILH radiative transfer models. In this modeling study, we developed an index that integrates advantages of indices minimizing soil background effects and indices that are sensitive to chlorophyll concentration. Simulated data have shown that the proposed index Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index/Optimized Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (TCARI/OSAVI) is both very sensitive to chlorophyll content variations and very resistant to the variations of LAI and solar zenith angle. It was therefore possible to generate a predictive equation to estimate leaf chlorophyll content from the combined optical index derived from above-canopy reflectance. This relationship was evaluated by application to hyperspectral CASI imagery collected over corn crops in three experimental farms from Ontario and Quebec, Canada. The results presented here are from the L'Acadie, Quebec, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada research site. Images of predicted leaf chlorophyll content were generated. Evaluation showed chlorophyll variability over crop plots with various levels of nitrogen, and revealed an excellent agreement with ground truth, with a correlation of r2=.81 between estimated and field measured chlorophyll content data.},

A different set of 14 sites of the same species were used in 2000 for validation of methodologies. Infinite reflectance and canopy reflectance models were used to link leaf to canopy levels through radiative transfer simulation. The closed and dense (LAI{\textgreater}4) forest canopies of Acer saccharum M. used for this study, and the high spatial resolution reflectance data targeting crowns, allowed the use of optically thick simulation formulae and turbid-medium SAILH and MCRM canopy reflectance models for chlorophyll content estimation by scaling-up and by numerical model inversion approaches through coupling to the PROSPECT leaf radiative transfer model. Study of the merit function in the numerical inversion showed that red edge optical indices used in the minimizing function such as R750/R710 perform better than when all single spectral reflectance channels from hyper-spectral airborne CASI data are used, and in addition, the effect of shadows and LAI variation are minimized},

Over two successive seasons, canopy reflectance spectra and disease index (DI) were measured five times during the growth of wheat plants (3 varieties) infected with varying amounts of yellow rust. Airborne hyperspectral images of the field site were also acquired in the second season. The PRI exhibited a significant, negative, linear, relationship with DI in the first season (r2 = 0.91, n = 64), which was insensitive to both variety and stage of crop development from Zadoks stage 3–9. Application of the PRI regression equation to measured spectral data in the second season yielded a coefficient of determination of r2 = 0.97 (n = 80). Application of the same PRI regression equation to airborne hyperspectral imagery in the second season also yielded a coefficient of determination of DI of r2 = 0.91 (n = 120).

This included the differences in the wavelength position of the red edge and in the reflectance values in the range of 690 to 710 nm. Both characteristics were found to be dependent on leaf chlorophyll concentration. The first derivative of reflectance spectra showed four peaks at 685-706, 710, 725 and 740 nm that were dependent in different degree on leaf age and pigment concentration in the leaves. The position and the magnitude of the first peak showed a high correlation with the leaf chlorophyll concentration. Reflectance at 700 nm was linearly dependent on the wavelength of the first peak. Variation of inflection point position with change in chlorophyll content was found small for yellow-green to dark green leaves (total chlorophyll in the range above 10 nmol/cm2). Reflectance near 700 nm was found to be a very sensitive indicator of the red edge position as well as of chlorophyll concentration. The ratio of reflectances at 750 nm to that near 700 nm (R750/R700) was directly proportional (correlation r2 {\textgreater} 0.95) to chlorophyll concentration. The ratio R750/R700 as a newly established index for non-invasive in-vivo chlorophyll determination was tested by independent data sets in the range of Chl contents from 0.6 to more than 60nmol/cm2 of maple and chestnut leaves with an estimation error of Chl of less than 3.7 nmol/cm2.},

In view of the intensive discussions on climate change and its effect on living organisms on earth, it has become necessary to develop new methods and strategies to monitor and follow the changes in global plant distribution.

In this research, we focused on a vegetation analysis using spectral reflectance profiles linked to biochemical concentrations. We performed the spectroscopic measurements of Pistacia species at canopy and leaf levels. Concomitant chemical analyses of leaf and bark materials enabled the development of remote sensing (RS) indices of structure-related biochemicals and pigments. We developed RS indices for cellulose, lignin, chlorophyll, carotenoid, anthocyanin and wax. Since the wax was the least studied in this context and due to the fact that it is the first layer of the plant surface that interacts with the incident light, it deserved special attention and was assumed to affect the spectral reflectance and, in combination with the other biochemicals, to contribute to better species identification.

In the modeling process, we showed that apart from the major energy absorption spectral bands related to a given biochemical, there were supplementary bands that had a significant effect on the accuracy of the biochemical content estimation. Another factor affecting the accuracy of the biochemical estimation was the season. Thus, we divided the biochemical content estimation models into seasonal groups of spring, summer and fall. The RS indices developed in this work, together with literature-reported RS indices, were used for Pistacia classification. The accuracy (69\%) of species classification was significantly higher in spring at an early vegetation stage than in summer (50\%), and fall (37\%). As a proof of concept, the same sets of RS indices were also used for classifying the genera and families of various plants in the Mediterranean forest using EO1 Hyperion images. The accuracy of the classification maps was 79\%, when the full set of RS indices developed in this work was used.},

While studies using remote sensing data to classify and map tree species reach back several decades, a recent review on the status, potentials, challenges and outlooks in this realm is missing. Here, we search for major trends in remote sensing techniques for tree species classification and discuss the effectiveness of different sensors and algorithms based on a literature review.

This review demonstrates that the number of studies focusing on tree species classification has increased constantly over the last four decades and promising local scale approaches have been presented for several sensor types. However, there are few examples for tree species classifications over large geographic extents, and bridging the gap between current approaches and tree species inventories over large geographic extents is still one of the biggest challenges of this research field. Furthermore, we found only few studies which systematically described and examined the traits that drive the observed variance in the remote sensing signal and thereby enable or hamper species classifications. Most studies followed data-driven approaches and pursued an optimization of classification accuracy, while a concrete hypothesis or a targeted application was missing in all but a few exceptional studies.

We recommend that future research efforts focus stronger on the causal understanding of why tree species classification approaches work under certain conditions or – maybe even more important - why they do not work in other cases. This might require more complex field acquisitions than those typically used in the reviewed studies. At the same time, we recommend reducing the number of purely data-driven studies and algorithm-benchmarking studies as these studies are of limited value, especially if the experimental design is limited, e.g. the tree population is not representative and only a few sensors or acquisition settings are simultaneously investigated.},

	abstract = {Understanding evolutionary coordination among different life‐history traits is a key challenge for ecology and evolution. Here we develop a general quantitative model predicting how offspring size should scale with adult size by combining a simple model for life‐history evolution with a frequency‐dependent survivorship model. The key innovation is that larger offspring are afforded three different advantages during ontogeny: higher survivorship per time, a shortened juvenile phase, and advantage during size‐competitive growth. In this model, it turns out that size‐asymmetric advantage during competition is the factor driving evolution toward larger offspring sizes. For simplified and limiting cases, the model is shown to produce the same predictions as the previously existing theory on which it is founded. The explicit treatment of different survival advantages has biologically important new effects, mainly through an interaction between total maternal investment in reproduction and the duration of competitive growth. This goes on to explain alternative allometries between log offspring size and log adult size, as observed in mammals (\${\textbackslash}mathrm\{slope\}{\textbackslash},=0.95\$) and plants (\${\textbackslash}mathrm\{slope\}{\textbackslash},=0.54\$). Further, it suggests how these differences relate quantitatively to specific biological processes during recruitment. In these ways, the model generalizes across previous theory and provides explanations for some differences between major taxa.},

But this hyperspectral data suffers from dimensionality problem. It is one of the challenging tasks to extract the useful information with no or less loss of information. One such technique to extract the useful information is by using wavelet transformations. In this paper, a series of experiments have been presented to investigate the effectiveness of some wavelet based feature extraction of hyperspectral data. Three types of wavelets have been used which are Haar, Daubechies and Coiflets wavelets and the quality of reduced hyperspectral data has been assessed by determining the accuracy of classification of reduced data using Support Vector Machines classifier. The hyperspectral data has been reduced upto four decomposition levels. Among the wavelets used for feature extraction Daubechies wavelet gives consistently better accuracy than that produced from Coiflets wavelet. Also, 2-level decomposition is capable of preserving more useful information from the hyperspectral data. Furthermore, 2-level decomposition takes less time to extract features from the hyperspectral data than 1-level decomposition.},

Existing indices used to estimate grass quantity, such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are of limited value due to the saturation problem, especially in dense vegetation with 100\% leaf area cover. Therefore, there is need to explore new techniques to resolve the saturation problem. In this study we tested the utility of band depth analysis to estimate grass quantity in dense vegetation. Band depth indices calculated from continuum-removed spectra of Cenchrus ciliaris grass, measured at canopy level in the visible spectral domain (550–750 nm) were used to estimate biomass. Band depth analysis results were compared to two narrow band NDVIs calculated using near-infrared and red bands. Results indicate that, the band depth analysis methodology could estimate quantity with a high coefficient of determination of 0.81, 0.83, 0.86 and 0.85 for band depth (BD), band depth ratio (BDR), normalized band depth index (NBDI) and band depth normalized to area (BNA), respectively. Narrow band NDVIs yielded lower correlations (0.31 and 0.32 for NDVI 1 and NDVI 2, respectively). Thus, band depth can estimate quantity in densely vegetated areas where NDVI values reach an asymptote.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing techniques are widely used in many different areas of interest, i.e. urban studies, environmental studies, agriculture, etc., due to fact that they provide rapid, accurate and information over large areas with optimal time, spatial and spectral resolutions. Agricultural management is one of the most common application of remote sensing methods nowadays. Monitoring of agricultural sites and creating information regarding spatial distribution and characteristics of crops are important tasks to provide data for precision agriculture, crop management and registries of agricultural lands. For monitoring of cultivated areas many different types of remote sensing data can be used- most popular are multispectral satellites imagery. Such data allow for generating land use and land cover maps, based on various methods of image processing and remote sensing methods. This paper presents fusion of satellite and unnamed aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery for agricultural applications, especially for distinguishing crop types. Authors in their article presented chosen data fusion methods for satellite images and data obtained from low altitudes. Moreover the authors described pan- sharpening approaches and applied chosen pan- sharpening methods for multiresolution image fusion of satellite and UAV imagery. For such purpose, satellite images from Landsat- 8 OLI sensor and data collected within various UAV flights (with mounted RGB camera) were used. In this article, the authors not only had shown the potential of fusion of satellite and UAV images, but also presented the application of pan- sharpening in crop identification and management.},

	abstract = {With the development of hyperspectral remote sensing technology, the spectral resolution of the hyperspectral image data becomes denser, which results in large number of bands, high correlation between neighboring bands, and high data redundancy. It is necessary to reduce these bands before further analysis, such as land cover classification and target detection. Aiming at the classification task, this paper proposes an effective band selection method from the novel perspective of spectral shape similarity analysis with key points extraction and thus retains physical information of hyperspectral remote sensing images. The proposed approach takes all the bands of hyperspectral remote sensing images as time series. Firstly, spectral clustering is utilized to cluster all the training samples, which produces the prototypical spectral curves of each cluster. Then a set of initial candidate bands are obtained based on the extraction of key points from the processed hyperspectral curves, which preserve discriminative information and narrow down the candidate band subset for the following search procedure. Finally, filtering contiguous bands according to conditional mutual information and branch and bound search are further performed sequentially to gain the optimal band combination. To verify the effectiveness of the integrated band selection method put forward in this paper, classification employing the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is performed on the selected spectral bands. The experimental results on two publicly available benchmark data sets demonstrate that the presented approach can select those bands with discriminative information, usually about 10 out of 200 original bands. Compared with previous studies, the newly proposed method is competitive with far fewer bands selected and a lower computational complexity, while the classification accuracy remains comparable.},

Our approach is based on the assumption that high-dimensional data live in different subspaces with low dimensionality. We therefore propose a new parameterization of the Gaussian model which combines the ideas of dimension reduction and constraints on the model. This parameterization takes into account the specific subspace and the intrinsic dimension of each class to limit the number of parameters to estimate. In addition, it is possible to make additional assumptions on the model to further limit the number of parameters. Our experiments on artificial and real datasets highlight that HDDA is more efficient than classical methods in high-dimensional spaces and with small learning datasets.},

	abstract = {Infections of wheat, rye, oat and barley by Fusarium ssp. are serious problems worldwide due to the mycotoxins, potentially produced by the fungi. In 2005, limit values were issued by the EU commission to avoid health risks by mycotoxins, both for humans and animals. This increased the need to develop tools for early detection of infections. Occurrence of Fusarium-caused head blight disease can be detected by spectral analysis (400–1000 nm) before harvest. With this information, farmers could recognize Fusarium contaminations. They could, therefore, harvest the grains separately and supply it to other utilizations, if applicable. In the present study, wheat plants were analyzed using a hyper-spectral imaging system under laboratory conditions. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to differentiate spectra of diseased and healthy ear tissues in the wavelength ranges of 500–533 nm, 560–675 nm, 682–733 nm and 927–931 nm, respectively. Head blight could be successfully recognized during the development stages (BBCH-stages) 71–85. However, the best time for disease determination was at the beginning of medium milk stage (BBCH 75). Just after start of flowering (BBCH 65) and, again, in the fully ripe stage (BBCH 89), distinction by spectral analysis is impossible. With the imaging analysis method ‘Spectral Angle Mapper’ (SAM) the degree of disease was correctly classified (87\%) considering an error of visual rating of 10\%. However, SAM is time-consuming. It involves both the analysis of all spectral bands and the setup of reference spectra for classification. The application of specific spectral sub-ranges is a very promising alternative. The derived head blight index (HBI), which uses spectral differences in the ranges of 665–675 nm and 550–560 nm, can be a suitable outdoor classification method for the recognition of head blight. In these experiments, mean hit rates were 67\% during the whole study period (BBCH 65–89). However, if only the optimal classification time is considered, the accuracy of detection can be largely increased.},

A degree of congruence exists between the two analyses in that two separate fleshy-fruited clades, the Acmena and Myrtoid groups, are identified, as are the Eucalypt and Tristania groups, and Psiloxylon and Heteropyxis are the first lineages to diverge in both analyses.

Examples of technology integration across all of these domains are provided for large-scale protected area management and investigation of ecological dynamics. Most technologies are low-cost or open-source, and when deployed can reach economies of scale that reduce per-area costs dramatically.

	abstract = {Impacts of human civilization on ecosystems threaten global biodiversity. In a changing environment, traditional in situ approaches to biodiversity monitoring have made significant steps forward to quantify and evaluate BD at many scales but still, these methods are limited to comparatively small areas. Earth observation (EO) techniques may provide a solution to overcome this shortcoming by measuring entities of interest at different spatial and temporal scales.

This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the role of EO to detect, describe, explain, predict and assess biodiversity. Here, we focus on three main aspects related to biodiversity − taxonomic diversity, functional diversity and structural diversity, which integrate different levels of organization − molecular, genetic, individual, species, populations, communities, biomes, ecosystems and landscapes. In particular, we discuss the recording of taxonomic elements of biodiversity through the identification of animal and plant species. We highlight the importance of the spectral traits (ST) and spectral trait variations (STV) concept for EO-based biodiversity research. Furthermore we provide examples of spectral traits/spectral trait variations used in EO applications for quantifying taxonomic diversity, functional diversity and structural diversity. We discuss the use of EO to monitor biodiversity and habitat quality using different remote-sensing techniques. Finally, we suggest specifically important steps for a better integration of EO in biodiversity research.

EO methods represent an affordable, repeatable and comparable method for measuring, describing, explaining and modelling taxonomic, functional and structural diversity. Upcoming sensor developments will provide opportunities to quantify spectral traits, currently not detectable with EO, and will surely help to describe biodiversity in more detail. Therefore, new concepts are needed to tightly integrate EO sensor networks with the identification of biodiversity. This will mean taking completely new directions in the future to link complex, large data, different approaches and models.},

It has been repeatedly demonstrated that thicker cuticle is not superior as a water barrier, implying that other functions must be important.

* Here, we measured the mechanical properties, dry mass and density of isolated cuticle from 13 evergreen woody species of Australian forests.

* Summed adaxial and abaxial cuticle membrane mass per unit leaf area (CMA) varied from 2.95 to 27.4 g m−2 across species, and accounted for 6.7–24\% of lamina dry mass. Density of cuticle varied only from 1.04 to 1.24 g cm−3; thus variation in CMA was mostly due to variation in cuticle thickness. Thicker cuticle was more resistant to tearing. Tensile strength and modulus of elasticity of cuticle were much higher than those of leaf laminas, with significant differences between adaxial and abaxial cuticles.

* While cuticle membranes were thin, they could account for a significant fraction of leaf dry mass due to their high density. The substantial cost of thicker cuticle is probably offset by increased mechanical resistance which might confer longer leaf lifespans among evergreen species.},

Concurrently, a complex regulatory network controlling the synthesis of the cuticle is emerging. It has also become clear that the physiological role of the cuticle extends well beyond its primary function as a transpiration barrier, playing important roles in processes ranging from development to interaction with microbes.

Here, we compile a global database of 108753 trees for which stem diameter, height and crown diameter have all been measured, including 2395 trees harvested to measure aboveground biomass. Using this database, we develop general allometric models for estimating both the diameter and aboveground biomass of trees from attributes which can be remotely sensed – specifically height and crown diameter. We show that tree height and crown diameter jointly quantify the aboveground biomass of individual trees and find that a single equation predicts stem diameter from these two variables across the world's forests. These new allometric models provide an intuitive way of integrating remote sensing imagery into large-scale forest monitoring programmes and will be of key importance for parameterizing the next generation of dynamic vegetation models.},

To date, assessment of cuticle organization has been dominated by 2D imaging, using histochemical stains in conjunction with light and fluorescence microscopy. This strategy, while providing valuable information, has limitations because it attempts to describe a complex 3D structure in 2D. An imaging technique that could accurately resolve 3D architecture would provide valuable additions to the growing body of information on cuticle molecular biology and biochemistry. We present a novel application of 3D confocal scanning laser microscopy for visualizing the architecture, deposition patterns and micro-structure of plant cuticles, using the fluorescent stain auramine O. We demonstrate the utility of this technique by contrasting the fruit cuticle of wild-type tomato (Solanum lycopersicum cv. M82) with those of cutin-deficient mutants. We also introduce 3D cuticle modeling based on reconstruction of serial optical sections, and describe its use in identification of several previously unreported features of the tomato fruit cuticle.},

Epidermal microcharacters such as deposition of wax crystalloids, cuticle thickness, trichome types, size and density, stomata types and size, stomatal density and index were examined on the surface of 66 leaves of 11 accessions of P. vulgaris var. aborigineus by means of light and scanning electron microscopy. Unlike the leaves of cultivated beans, those of P. vulgaris var. aborigineus were hypostomatous. Among epidermal characters only the stomatal density, stomatal index, and the number of trichomes on the abaxial leaf epidermis were different between bean accessions. The stomatal density and index of the accessions were inversely related to the altitude of the area of the wild bean collection. This is the first report describing the presence of diversity among epidermal characters (e.g. hypostomatous leaves) in P. vulgaris var. aborigineus that might contribute to plant resistance to pathogens.},

No induction was seen on a glass surface coated with an inert wax which confered the same hydrophobicity to the surface as the leaf wax.

	abstract = {The surface of the primary aerial parts of terrestrial plants is covered by a cuticle, which has crucial autecological functions, but also serves as an important interface in trophic interactions. The chemical and physical properties of this layer contribute to these functions. The cuticle is composed of the cuticular layer and the cuticle proper, which is covered by epicuticular waxes. Whereas the cutin fraction is a polyester-type biopolymer composed of hydroxyl and hydroxyepoxy fatty acids, the cuticular waxes are a complex mixture of long-chain aliphatic and cyclic compounds. These highly lipophilic compounds determine the hydrophobic quality of the plant surface and, together with the microstructure of the waxes, vary in a species-specific manner. The physicochemical characteristics contribute to certain optical features, limit transpiration, and influence adhesion of particles and organisms. In chemical ecology, where interactions between organisms and the underlying (allelo-) chemical principles are studied, it is important to determine what is present at this interface between the plant and the environment. Several useful equations can allow estimation of the dissolution of a given organic molecule in the cuticle and its transport properties. The implementation of these equations is exemplified by examining glucosinolates, which play an important role in interactions of plants with other organisms. An accurate characterization of physicochemical properties of the plant surface is needed to understand its ecological significance. Here, we summarize current knowledge about the physical and chemical properties of plant cuticles and their role in interactions with microorganisms, phytophagous insects, and their antagonists.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic stress and disturbance of forest ecosystems (FES) has been increasing at all scales from local to global. In rapidly changing environments, in-situ terrestrial FES monitoring approaches have made tremendous progress but they are intensive and often integrate subjective indicators for forest health (FH). Remote sensing (RS) bridges the gaps of these limitations, by monitoring indicators of FH on different spatio-temporal scales, and in a cost-effective, rapid, repetitive and objective manner. In this paper, we provide an overview of the definitions of FH, discussing the drivers, processes, stress and adaptation mechanisms of forest plants, and how we can observe FH with RS. We introduce the concept of spectral traits (ST) and spectral trait variations (STV) in the context of FH monitoring and discuss the prospects, limitations and constraints. Stress, disturbances and resource limitations can cause changes in FES taxonomic, structural and functional diversity; we provide examples how the ST/STV approach can be used for monitoring these FES characteristics. We show that RS based assessments of FH indicators using the ST/STV approach is a competent, affordable, repetitive and objective technique for monitoring. Even though the possibilities for observing the taxonomic diversity of animal species is limited with RS, the taxonomy of forest tree species can be recorded with RS, even though its accuracy is subject to certain constraints. RS has proved successful for monitoring the impacts from stress on structural and functional diversity. In particular, it has proven to be very suitable for recording the short-term dynamics of stress on FH, which cannot be cost-effectively recorded using in-situ methods. This paper gives an overview of the ST/STV approach, whereas the second paper of this series concentrates on discussing in-situ terrestrial monitoring, in-situ RS approaches and RS sensors and techniques for measuring ST/STV for FH.},

	abstract = {Species richness is a widespread measure to evaluate the effect of different management histories on plant communities and their biodiversity. However, analysing the phylogenetic structure of plant communities could provide new insights into the effects of different management methods on community assemblages and provide further guidance for conservation decisions. Heathlands require permanent management to ensure the existence of such a cultural landscape. While traditional management with grazing is time consuming, mechanical methods are often applied but their consequences on the phylogenetic community assemblages are still unclear. We sampled 60 vegetation plots in dry sandy heathlands (EU habitat type 2310) in northern Germany stratified by five different heathland management histories: fire, plaggen (turf cutting), mowing, deforestation and intensive grazing. Due to the distant relationship of vascular plants and lichens, we assembled two phylogenetic trees, one for vascular plants and one for lichens. We then calculated phylogenetic diversity (PD) and measures of phylogenetic community structure for vascular plant and lichen communities. Deforested areas supported significantly higher PD values for vascular plant communities. We found that PD was strongly correlated with species richness (SR) but the calculation of rarefied PD was uncorrelated to SR leading to a different ranking of management histories. We observed phylogenetic clustering in the lichen communities but not for vascular plants. Thus, management by mowing and intensive grazing promotes habitat filtering of lichens, while management histories that cause greater disturbance such as fire and plaggen do not seem to affect phylogenetic community structure. The set of management strategies fulfilled the goals of the managers in maintaining a healthy heathland community structure. However, management strategies that cause less disturbance can offer an additional range of habitat for other taxonomic groups such as lichen communities.},

It was adapted from other disciplines for use in ecology and evolutionary biology beginning in the early 1990s, and, at the turn of the century, has begun to have a substantial impact on the way data are summarized in these fields. We identify 119 studies concerned with meta-analysis in ecology and evolution, the earliest published in 1991 and the most recent in 2000. We introduce the statistical methods used in modern meta-analysis with references to the well-developed literature in the field. These formal, statistically defensible methods have been established to determine average treatment effects across studies when a common research question is being investigated, to establish confidence limits around the average effect size, and to test for consistency or lack of agreement in effect size as well as explanations for differences in the magnitude of the effect among studies. Problems with popular but statistically flawed methods for the quantitative summary of research results have been pointed out, and their use is diminishing. We discuss a number of challenges and threats to the validity of meta-analysis in ecology and evolution. In particular, we examine how difficulties resulting from missing data, publication bias, data quality and data exclusion, non-independence among observations, and the combination of dissimilar data sets may affect the perceived utility of meta-analysis in these fields and the soundness of conclusions drawn from its application. We highlight particular applications of meta-analysis in ecology and evolution, discuss several controversies surrounding individual meta-analyses, and outline some of the practical issues involved in carrying out a meta-analysis. Finally, we suggest changes that would improve the quality of data synthesis in ecology and evolutionary biology, and predict future directions for this emerging enterprise.},

	abstract = {Satellite remote sensing data constitute a significant potential source of information on our environment, provided they can be adequately interpreted. Vegetation indexes, a subset of the class of spectral indexes, represent one of the most commonly used approaches to analyze data in the optical domain. An optimal spectral index is very sensitive to the desired information (e.g. the amount of vegetation), and as insensitive as possible to perturbing factors (such as soil color changes or atmospheric effects). Since both the desired signal and the perturbing factors vary spectrally, and since the instruments themselves only provide data for particular spectral bands, optimal indexes should be designed for specific applications and particular instruments. This paper describes a rational approach to the design of an optimal index to estimate vegetation properties on the basis of the red and near-infrared reflectances of the AVHRR instrument, taking into account the perturbing effects of soil brightness changes, atmospheric absorption and scattering. The rationale behind the Global Environment Monitoring index (GEMI) is explained, and this index is proposed as an alternative to the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for global applications. The techniques described here are generally applicable to any multispectral sensor and application},

Not all approaches are appropriate for all questions, and researchers should decide which approach addresses their questions. This work demonstrated the use of each approach: for example, random forests provided a robust and enlightening description of both the clustering of metagenomes and the metabolic processes that were important in separating microbial communities from different environments. All analyses identified that the presence of phage genes within the microbial community was a predictor of whether the microbial community was host associated or free living. Several analyses identified the subtle differences that occur with environments, such as those seen in different regions of the marine environment.},

	abstract = {Stress in forest ecosystems (FES) occurs as a result of land-use intensification, disturbances, resource limitations or unsustainable management, causing changes in forest health (FH) at various scales from the local to the global scale. Reactions to such stress depend on the phylogeny of forest species or communities and the characteristics of their impacting drivers and processes. There are many approaches to monitor indicators of FH using in-situ forest inventory and experimental studies, but they are generally limited to sample points or small areas, as well as being time- and labour-intensive. Long-term monitoring based on forest inventories provides valuable information about changes and trends of FH. However, abrupt short-term changes cannot sufficiently be assessed through in-situ forest inventories as they usually have repetition periods of multiple years. Furthermore, numerous FH indicators monitored in in-situ surveys are based on expert judgement. Remote sensing (RS) technologies offer means to monitor FH indicators in an effective, repetitive and comparative way. This paper reviews techniques that are currently used for monitoring, including close-range RS, airborne and satellite approaches. The implementation of optical, RADAR and LiDAR RS-techniques to assess spectral traits/spectral trait variations (ST/STV) is described in detail. We found that ST/STV can be used to record indicators of FH based on RS. Therefore, the ST/STV approach provides a framework to develop a standardized monitoring concept for FH indicators using RS techniques that is applicable to future monitoring programs. It is only through linking in-situ and RS approaches that we will be able to improve our understanding of the relationship between stressors, and the associated spectral responses in order to develop robust FH indicators.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing (RS) is a powerful tool to measure and monitor Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) and their environmental drivers. Despite this potential, stronger integration between remote sensing experts and the ecological community could better support biodiversity initiatives. Here we highlight opportunities to harness remote sensing technology to better understand biodiversity patterns, ecological processes and the consequences for ecosystem services (ESs). We argue that tracking many EBVs using remote sensing should prioritize the monitoring of dominant species, a scalable property across multiple EBV classes, for several reasons. First, a few dominant species in an ecological community disproportionately contribute to the satellite spectral signature. Second, a focus on dominance would enable a stronger links to ecological research, as dominance reflects the ecological community context (i.e. relative abundance of coexisting species). For example dominant species should be especially important contributors to many ecosystem functions and services that rely on abundance or biomass, such as carbon storage or nutrient cycling, because of their greater representation in a community. Furthermore, global change impacts on communities may be reflected in changing dominance structure before the losses of species, thus tracking dominance provides an early-warning sign of community change for EBVs. Finally, focusing on dominant species should improve understanding of spatial and temporal dynamics of dominance-driven ESs through RS mapping. Given the importance of dominant species to ecological communities and ESs, monitoring dominance under changing environmental conditions and human impacts should be a global priority.},

IFLs are critical for stabilizing terrestrial carbon storage, harboring biodiversity, regulating hydrological regimes, and providing other ecosystem functions. Although the remaining IFLs comprise only 20\% of tropical forest area, they account for 40\% of the total aboveground tropical forest carbon. We show that global IFL extent has been reduced by 7.2\% since the year 2000. An increasing rate of global IFL area reduction was found, largely driven by the tripling of IFL tropical forest loss in 2011–2013 compared to that in 2001–2003. Industrial logging, agricultural expansion, fire, and mining/resource extraction were the primary causes of IFL area reduction. Protected areas (International Union for Conservation of Nature categories I to III) were found to have a positive effect in slowing the reduction of IFL area from timber harvesting but were less effective in limiting agricultural expansion. The certification of logging concessions under responsible management had a negligible impact on slowing IFL fragmentation in the Congo Basin. Fragmentation of IFLs by logging and establishment of roads and other infrastructure initiates a cascade of changes that lead to landscape transformation and loss of conservation values. Given that only 12\% of the global IFL area is protected, our results illustrate the need for planning and investment in carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation efforts that target the most valuable remaining forests, as identified using the IFL approach.
Intact forest landscapes have the greatest conservation value but are shrinking due to industrial logging and fragmentation.

By combining one of humankind’s oldest technologies, textile processing, with electroactive polymers, we demonstrate here the feasibility of wearable, soft artificial muscles made by weaving and knitting, with tunable force and strain. These textile actuators were produced from cellulose yarns assembled into fabrics and coated with conducting polymers using a metal-free deposition. To increase the output force, we assembled yarns in parallel by weaving. The force scaled linearly with the number of yarns in the woven fabric. To amplify the strain, we knitted a stretchable fabric, exhibiting a 53-fold increase in strain. In addition, the textile construction added mechanical stability to the actuators. Textile processing permits scalable and rational production of wearable artificial muscles, and enables novel ways to design assistive devices.
Textile artificial muscles were developed using weaving to increase the force and knitting to amplify the strain.

We performed studies with the CBL in temperate and tropical forests, caves, salt marshes and coastal areas subject to erosion. By facilitating additional scanning points, and therefore view angles, this new class of terrestrial lidar alters observation coverage within samples, potentially reducing uncertainty in estimates of ecosystem properties. The CBL has proved competent at reconstructing trees and mangrove roots using the same cylinder-based Quantitative Structure Models commonly utilized for data from more capable instruments (Raumonen et al. 2013). For tropical trees with morphologies that challenge standard reconstruction techniques, such as the buttressed roots of Ceiba trees and the multiple stems of strangler figs, the CBL was able to provide the versatility and the speed of deployment needed to fully characterize their unique features. For geomorphological features, the deployment flexibility of the CBL enabled sampling from optimal view-angles, including from a novel suspension system for sampling salt marsh creeks. Overall, the practical aspects of these instruments, which improve deployment logistics, and therefore data acquisition rate, are shown to be emerging capabilities, greatly increasing the potential for observation, particularly in highly temporally dynamic, inaccessible and geometrically complex ecosystems. In order to better analyze information quality across these diverse and challenging ecosystems, we also provide a novel and much-needed conceptual framework, the microstate model, to characterize and mitigate uncertainties in terrestrial lidar observations.},

The patterns of abaxial surface sculpturing and arrangement of outer stomatal rims are unique in the New World species. The majority of the Old W'orld species showed different anticlinal wall patterns on the adaxial and abaxial epidermises. In the majority of the New World species the anticlinal wall patterns are more or less the same except in E. axillaris. The paracytic type of stomata, with a non-prominent T-piece cutinization at the poles of the guard cells, is a characteristic feature of the New World species. The taxonomic significance of these features in identification and elucidation of species from both areas is discussed.},

Twelve characters proved useful for the identification of species: type of stomata; shape of leaves in T.S.; shape of midrib bundle; sclerenchyma sheath; cutinization of outer epidermal wall; presence or absence of sclereids, idioblasts, hypodermis, columnar epidermal cells, solitary crystals; number of palisade layers and the shape of vascular strand, sclerenchyma sheath and sclereids in the parenchyma of the petiole. Using these characters an anatomical key was constructed to assist identification of the species. Only the closely related species E. stapfiana and E. nilidula could not be separated on anatomical characters.

This type of cell wall modification is mainly composed of a polyester matrix, cutin, and soluble waxes embedded in the matrix and deposited on the external surface. Cuticle-associated proteins may also be important. Recent observations are starting to reveal complex inter-relationships between cuticular lipids and immunity. This suggests that the cuticle is not simply a physical barrier, but a dynamic host defense with signaling circuits and effector molecules. Furthermore, these studies have also demonstrated that cuticular lipids and immunity may intersect in common pathways, although the significance of this is not fully understood. In this review, we examine the functions of the plant cuticle in host–pathogen interactions, and discuss the possibilities of integrating the membrane and cuticular glycerolipid biosynthesis.},

	abstract = {In this study, we investigated the utility of hyperspectral remote sensing data for estimating green percent vegetation cover (PVC) for a study site in the Canadian High Arctic. A field experiment was conducted on Sabine Peninsula (76°27′ N, 108°33′ W), Melville Island, Nunavut, Canada to collect field spectra and PVC for five vegetation types, i.e., polar semi-desert (PD), dry mesic tundra (DMT), mesic tundra (MT), wet mesic tundra (WMT) and wet sedge/moss (WSM). Based on field spectra, two types of 2-band hyperspectral (i.e., Hyperion) and multispectral (i.e., WorldView-3) vegetation indices (VIs) were derived using all possible band combinations. Optimal spectral bands were identified based on their correlations with green PVC. In addition, VIs designed for other landscapes were examined for their ability to estimate green PVC in an Arctic environment. The results indicate that PVC and spectral features for Arctic vegetation types were related to moisture content: (1) vegetation types with dry to intermediate soil moisture (e.g., PD, DMT and MT) possessed large amounts of bare soil and exhibited spectral properties similar to bare soil; and (2) vegetation types with high moisture content (e.g., WMT and WSM) exhibited spectra similar to senescent vegetation given the substantial proportion of senescent vegetation in these vegetation types. The optimal Hyperion spectral bands for estimating green PVC were located at the absorption features observed in Arctic vegetation spectra, including 681.20 nm (leaf pigment absorption); 721.90 nm and 732.07 nm (along the red-edge slope); 1174.77 nm and 1184.87 nm (leaf water absorption); and 1447.14 nm, 1457.23 nm, 2072.65 nm and 2102.94 nm (leaf cellulose and lignin absorption). Narrowband VIs exhibited a stronger correlation with green PVC than broadband VIs due to the finer spectral features sampled by hyperspectral data. Further, VIs designed to estimate leaf pigment and dry matter content (e.g., lignin and cellulose) showed strong correlations with green PVC.},

	abstract = {One of the biodiversity metrics to track from space is the spatial variability in reflectance that has previously been proposed as a proxy of species counts per unit area. The corresponding hypothesis is known as the spectral variability hypothesis (SVH). Little attention has been paid so far to the questions whether the SVH holds over broader regions and across time. Here, we addressed these questions by using a spatially contiguous dataset of vascular plant species occurrences in Southern Germany along with MODIS data at 14 time steps. The floristic dataset consists of species occurrence data for 815 areas of 10 longitudinal by 6 latitudinal minutes (approximately 12 km by 11 km, referred to as mapping units). The spectral variability in space (within these units) was determined using MODIS pixels of 0.5 km by 0.5 km. We used two different measures of spectral variability in combination with a moving window approach to derive statistical links between spectral variability and species counts through space and time. The moving windows consisting of several mapping units were shifted in space and meanwhile used as target areas for correlation analyses.
The performance of the spectral variability to predict species counts was influenced by the location and the extent of the reference windows. In some regions, high spectral variability was connected to high species counts. In other regions, comparably low spectral variability was linked to high species counts and vice versa. Furthermore, the relation between spectral variability and species varied with season. Certain areas changed from almost no correlation to very high correlation depending on the applied scene. Also, the applied spectral variability measure had a notable influence on the observed results.
Based on these results, we conclude that the spectral variability hypothesis does not hold across landscapes at this spatial grain. Using spectral variability alone as a proxy for species counts in a monitoring approach for larger extents and grains is therefore unlikely to work in many parts of the world. This does not mean that it cannot help as a covariate in analyses with more predictors.},

	abstract = {Plant responses to biotic and abiotic legacies left in soil by preceding plants is known as plant–soil feedback (PSF). PSF is an important mechanism to explain plant community dynamics and plant performance in natural and agricultural systems. However, most PSF studies are short-term and small-scale due to practical constraints for field-scale quantification of PSF effects, yet field experiments are warranted to assess actual PSF effects under less controlled conditions. Here we used unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based optical sensors to test whether PSF effects on plant traits can be quantified remotely. We established a randomized agro-ecological field experiment in which six different cover crop species and species combinations from three different plant families (Poaceae, Fabaceae, Brassicaceae) were grown. The feedback effects on plant traits were tested in oat (Avena sativa) by quantifying the cover crop legacy effects on key plant traits: height, fresh biomass, nitrogen content, and leaf chlorophyll content. Prior to destructive sampling, hyperspectral data were acquired and used for calibration and independent validation of regression models to retrieve plant traits from optical data. Subsequently, for each trait the model with highest precision and accuracy was selected. We used the hyperspectral analyses to predict the directly measured plant height (RMSE  =  5.12 cm, R2  =  0.79), chlorophyll content (RMSE  =  0.11 g m−2, R2  =  0.80), N-content (RMSE  =  1.94 g m−2, R2  =  0.68), and fresh biomass (RMSE  =  0.72 kg m−2, R2  =  0.56). Overall the PSF effects of the different cover crop treatments based on the remote sensing data matched the results based on in situ measurements. The average oat canopy was tallest and its leaf chlorophyll content highest in response to legacy of Vicia sativa monocultures (100 cm, 0.95 g m−2, respectively) and in mixture with Raphanus sativus (100 cm, 1.09 g m−2, respectively), while the lowest values (76 cm, 0.41 g m−2, respectively) were found in response to legacy of Lolium perenne monoculture, and intermediate responses to the legacy of the other treatments. We show that PSF effects in the field occur and alter several important plant traits that can be sensed remotely and quantified in a non-destructive way using UAV-based optical sensors; these can be repeated over the growing season to increase temporal resolution. Remote sensing thereby offers great potential for studying PSF effects at field scale and relevant spatial-temporal resolutions which will facilitate the elucidation of the underlying mechanisms.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of the classification of hyperspectral remote sensing images by support vector machines (SVMs). First, we propose a theoretical discussion and experimental analysis aimed at understanding and assessing the potentialities of SVM classifiers in hyperdimensional feature spaces. Then, we assess the effectiveness of SVMs with respect to conventional feature-reduction-based approaches and their performances in hypersubspaces of various dimensionalities. To sustain such an analysis, the performances of SVMs are compared with those of two other nonparametric classifiers (i.e., radial basis function neural networks and the K-nearest neighbor classifier). Finally, we study the potentially critical issue of applying binary SVMs to multiclass problems in hyperspectral data. In particular, four different multiclass strategies are analyzed and compared: the one-against-all, the one-against-one, and two hierarchical tree-based strategies. Different performance indicators have been used to support our experimental studies in a detailed and accurate way, i.e., the classification accuracy, the computational time, the stability to parameter setting, and the complexity of the multiclass architecture. The results obtained on a real Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectroradiometer hyperspectral dataset allow to conclude that, whatever the multiclass strategy adopted, SVMs are a valid and effective alternative to conventional pattern recognition approaches (feature-reduction procedures combined with a classification method) for the classification of hyperspectral remote sensing data.},

	abstract = {Small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based remote sensing is a rapidly evolving technology. Novel sensors and methods are entering the market, offering completely new possibilities to carry out remote sensing tasks. Three-dimensional (3D) hyperspectral remote sensing is a novel and powerful technology that has recently become available to small UAVs. This study investigated the performance of UAV-based photogrammetry and hyperspectral imaging in individual tree detection and tree species classification in boreal forests. Eleven test sites with 4151 reference trees representing various tree species and developmental stages were collected in June 2014 using a UAV remote sensing system equipped with a frame format hyperspectral camera and an RGB camera in highly variable weather conditions. Dense point clouds were measured photogrammetrically by automatic image matching using high resolution RGB images with a 5 cm point interval. Spectral features were obtained from the hyperspectral image blocks, the large radiometric variation of which was compensated for by using a novel approach based on radiometric block adjustment with the support of in-flight irradiance observations. Spectral and 3D point cloud features were used in the classification experiment with various classifiers. The best results were obtained with Random Forest and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) which both gave 95\% overall accuracies and an F-score of 0.93. Accuracy of individual tree identification from the photogrammetric point clouds varied between 40\% and 95\%, depending on the characteristics of the area. Challenges in reference measurements might also have reduced these numbers. Results were promising, indicating that hyperspectral 3D remote sensing was operational from a UAV platform even in very difficult conditions. These novel methods are expected to provide a powerful tool for automating various environmental close-range remote sensing tasks in the very near future.},

Septoria tritici, leaf senescence and Erysiphe graminis were studied. Observer estimates were widely scattered about the actual severities (i.e. they were imprecise), differed substantially from the actual severities even after averaging (i.e. they were inacctirate), and varied considerably over short time-scales. Relative bias decreased with increasing disease severity. In a comparison of three seed treatments to control powdery mildew on winter barley, visual assessment errors altered the conclusions of the experiment. Two treatments were statistically indistinguishable on the basis of visual severity estimates, while estimates obtained by image analysis showed that one seed treatment was twice as effective as the other.},

The video-based detection system produced a spatially resolved, quantifiable signal that was highly specific for chlorophyll fluorescence. Video images of spatial variation in the initial stage of the fluorescence induction (dark-light) transient revealed discreet regions of intense emission coinciding with centers of subsequent lesion development and accompanying chlorosis. Incipient lesions were visible by this procedure 3 d following inoculation, fully 3 to 4 d prior to visible symptoms. Fluorescence emission patterns in infected areas during the induction transient were heterogeneous with radial distance from the point of invasion and varied with the length of the time delay between re-illumination and image capture. During later ([greater than or equal to]1 min) stages of the induction transient, fluorescence emission in incipient lesions was quenched compared to surrounding tissue. These essential features of the induction transient observed in video images were also noted when individual lesions were examined using pulse modulation fluorimetry.},

	abstract = {Green plants illuminated with UV-radiation emit a blue and green fluorescence as well as a red and farred chlorophyll fluorescence with maxima near 440, 520, 690 and 740 nm, respectively. In contrast to point data measurements, the establishment of a high spatial resolution multi-colour fluorescence imaging system, the Karlsruhe/Strasbourg Fluorescence Imaging System (FIS), permits to simultaneously screen several hundred picture elements (pixels) of the leaf in the four fluorescence bands of plants, and opens new possibilities for physiology measurements and early stress detection. This review describes the principles and particular characteristics a) of the plants' fluorescence signatures, b) of fluorescence imaging in general and c) of the Karlsruhe/Strasbourg high resolution multi-colour fluorescence imaging system FIS. The origin of the fluorescence signals in the blue and green (cinnamic acids and other plant phenolics), the red and far-red (chlorophyll a) and the factors influencing these fluorescence signatures are explained. By means of an intensified video camera, fluorescence images with several hundred picture elements are taken, not only of the red and far-red Chl fluorescence, but also of the blue and green plant fluorescence, as multicolour images. Via computer-aided data processing one obtains false colour images not only of the fluorescence intensity, but also of the fluorescence ratios of whole leaves. The fluorescence ratios blue/red (F440/ F690) and blue/far-red (F440/F740) proved to be very sensitive early stress and strain indicators of plants. The fluorescence ratio F690/F740 is an indicator of the in situ Chl content. By fluorescence imaging of the variable Chl fluorescence (Rfd-values) one can also simultaneously measure the potential photosynthetic activity of all points of a leaf. At short-term stress, the fluorescence ratio blue/green (F440/F520) is relatively stable, but changes at long-term stress, often by an increase of the green fluorescence emission. Due to the high statistic confidence (large pixel numbers) and the excellent possibilities to detect specific distribution gradients and local irregularities in fluorescence emission and fluorescence ratios over the leaf area, fluorescence imaging is a superior means for early stress and damage detection in plants.},

In the first stage, binary subsets between samples originating from diseased and non-diseased cattle are defined along known covariates within the data set. Random forests are then used to select spectral channels on each subset, on the basis of a multivariate measure of variable importance, the Gini importance. The selected features are then used to establish binary discriminations within each subset by means of ridge regression. In the second stage of the hierarchical procedure the predictions from all linear classifiers are used as input to another random forest that provides the final classification. When applied to an independent, blinded validation set of 160 further spectra (84 BSE-positives, 76 BSE-negatives), the hierarchical classifier achieves a sensitivity of 92\% and a specificity of 95\%. Compared with results from an earlier study based on the same data, the hierarchical scheme performs better than linear discriminant analysis with features selected by genetic optimization and robust linear discriminant analysis, and performs as well as a neural network and a support vector machine.Open image in new window},

It is concluded that spectral reflectance techniques are unlikely to be used for measuring soil properties as other technologies are better suited to this application. Spectral reflectance techniques can be used to detect weeds against a soil background but with current approaches cannot reliably identify weeds at sufficiently low populations (plants m−2) in a growing crop to control commercial herbicide applications. Spectral reflectance techniques also provide useful information about the crop canopy that can be used as a component in determining the fungicide, growth regulator and nitrogen inputs to a cereal crop.},

However, the success of utilizing these two methods in discriminating late blight infected tomatoes (caused by Phytophthora infestans ) from healthy ones has not yet been reported. This paper demonstrates the capability of using principal component analysis and cluster analysis for identification and discrimination of spectral characteristics of late blight infections on tomatoes. Our results show that the first principal component is related to the spectral properties of healthy tomatoes, and the second principal component is related to the spectral properties of infected tomatoes. Cluster analysis shows that a reasonable discrimination is obtained when the centroid distance of clusters is above 0.5. The consistent results from both principal components analysis and cluster analysis indicate that late blight infection on tomatoes can be successfully detected with remote sensing when the infection severity reaches middle to late stages. Moreover, spectral ratio analysis provides us with the way to identify the sensitive spectral wavelengths where distinguishable reflectance values can be observed for unique biological features. Understanding the light responses to unique biological features may increase discrimination accuracy by reducing the impact of soil background on spectral measurements, and utilizing the most sensitive wavelengths for discriminating between healthy and diseased tomatoes.},

The feasibility was investigated for discriminating citrus greening by use of near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and least square support vector machine (LS-SVM). The spectra of sound and citrus greening samples were recorded in the wavenumber range of 4000-9000 cm-1. The preprocessing method of second derivative with a gap of seven was adapted to eliminate spectral baseline. The spectral variables were optimized by principal component analysis (PCA) and (UVE) algorithms. The unknown samples were used to access the performance of the models. Compared to the PLS-DA model, the LS-SVM was better with the input vector of the first 15 principal components and linear kernel function. The regularization factor (γ) of linear kernel function was 1.8756, and the operation time of LS-SVM model was 0.86s. The recognition error of the LS-SVM model was zero. The results showed that the combination of LS-SVM and NIR spectroscopy could detect citrus greening nondestructively and rapidly.},

* Divergence times for {\textgreater} 20 genera of rust fungi were studied with Bayesian evolutionary analyses. A relaxed molecular clock was applied to ribosomal and mitochondrial genes, calibrated against estimated divergence times for the hosts of rust fungi, such as Acacia (Fabaceae), angiosperms and the cupressophytes.


* Results showed that rust fungi shared a most recent common ancestor with a mean age between 113 and 115 million yr. This dates rust fungi to the Cretaceous period, which is much younger than previous estimations. Host jumps, whether taxonomically large or between host genera in the same family, most probably shaped the diversity of rust genera. Likewise, species diversified by host shifts (through coevolution) or via subsequent host jumps. This is in contrast to strict coevolution with their hosts.


* Puccinia psidii was recovered in Sphaerophragmiaceae, a family distinct from Raveneliaceae, which were regarded as confamilial in previous studies.},

	abstract = {While hyperspectral sensors describe plant canopy reflectance in greater detail than multispectral sensors, they also suffer from issues with data redundancy and spectral autocorrelation. Data mining techniques that extract relevant spectral features from hyperspectral data will aid the development of novel sensors for plant trait estimation. The objectives of this research were to (1) compare broad-band reflectance, narrow-band reflectance, and spectral derivatives for estimation of durum wheat traits in the field and (2) develop a genetic algorithm to identify the most relevant spectral features for durum wheat trait estimation. Experiments at Maricopa, Arizona during the winters of 2010–2011 and 2011–2012 tested six durum wheat cultivars with six split-applied nitrogen (N) fertilization rates. Durum wheat traits, including leaf area index, canopy dry weight, and plant N content, were measured from destructive biomass samples on four occassions in each growing season. Grain yield and grain N content were also measured. Canopy spectral reflectance data in 701 narrow wavebands from 350 nm to 1050 nm were collected weekly using a field spectroradiometer. First- and second-order spectral derivatives were calculated using Savitzky-Golay filtering. The narrow-band data were also used to estimate reflectance in broad wavebands, as typically collected by two commercial multispectral instruments. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) compared the ability of each spectral data set to estimate each measured durum wheat trait. A genetic algorithm was developed to mine narrow-band canopy reflectance and spectral derivative data for spectral features that improved estimates of durum wheat traits. Multispectral data in 4 broad bands estimated leaf area index, canopy dry weight, and plant N content with root mean squared errors of cross validation (RMSECV) between 33.0\% and 67.6\%, while hyperspectral data in 701 narrow bands reduced RMSECV to values between 19.3\% and 36.3\%. Use of the genetic algorithm to identify less than 25 relevant spectral features further reduced RMSECV to values between 15.1\% and 30.7\%. Grain yield was optimally estimated from canopy spectral measurements between 110 and 130 days after planting with RMSECV less than 7.6\% using the genetic algorithm approach. The timing corresponded to anthesis and early grain fill when presence of wheat heads likely affected canopy spectral reflectance. By using a genetic algorithm to mine hyperspectral reflectance and spectral derivative data, durum wheat traits were optimally estimated from a subset of relevant canopy spectral features.},

Different platforms from proximal to remote sensing are available for multiscale monitoring of single crop organs or entire fields. Accurate and reliable detection of diseases is facilitated by highly sophisticated and innovative methods of data analysis that lead to new insights derived from sensor data for complex plant-pathogen systems.

Foliar N concentrations are used to diagnose soil and plant fertility levels and to develop N fertilizer application rates. Normally, foliar N is obtained using destructive methods, but indirect analyses using Vegetation Indexes (VIs) may be possible. The aim of this work was to evaluate VIs to estimate foliar N concentration in three Eucalyptus clones. Lower crown leaves of three clonal Eucalyptus plantations (25 months old) were classified into five color patterns using the Munsell Plant Tissue Color Chart. For each color, N concentration was determined by the Kjeldahl method and foliar reflectance was measured using a CI-710 Miniature Leaf Spectrometer. Foliar reflectance data were used to obtain the VIs and the VIs were used to estimate N concentrations. In the visible region, the relationship between N concentration and reflectance percentage was negative. The highest correlations between VIs and N concentrations were obtained by the Inflection Point Position (IPP, r = 0.97), Normalized Difference Red-Edge (reNDVI, r = 0.97) and Modified Red-Edge Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (mNDI, r = 0.97). Vegetation indexes on the red edge region provided the most accurate estimates of foliar N concentration. The reNDVI index provided the best N concentration estimates in leaves of different colors of Eucalyptus urophylla × grandis and Eucalyptus urophylla × urophylla (R2 = 0.97 and RMSE = 0.91 g kg−1).Key words: leaf nitrogen concentration; non-destructive analyses; spectrometer; spectral reflectance; leaf reflectance},

In the present study, we investigated the role of cuticle membrane in Arabidopsis responses to oxygen deficiency. TEM analysis showed that the epidermal cells of hypoxia-treated Arabidopsis stems and leaves possessed a thinner electron-translucent cuticle proper and a more electron-dense cuticular layer. A reduction in epicuticular wax crystal deposition was observed in SEM images of hypoxia-treated Arabidopsis stem compared with normoxic control. Cuticular transpiration was more rapid in hypoxia-stressed leaves than in normoxic control. Total wax and cutin loads decreased by approximately 6–12 and 12–22\%, respectively, and the levels of C29 alkanes, secondary alcohols, and ketones, C16:0 ω-hydroxy fatty acids, and C18:2 dicarboxylic acids were also prominently reduced in hypoxia-stressed Arabidopsis leaves and/or stems relative to normoxic control. Genome-wide transcriptome and quantitative RT-PCR analyses revealed that the expression of several genes involved in the biosynthesis and transport of cuticular waxes and cutin monomers were downregulated more than fourfold, but no significant alterations were detected in the transcript levels of fatty acid biosynthetic genes, BCCP2, PDH-E1α, and ENR1 in hypoxia-treated Arabidopsis stems and leaves compared with normoxic control. Taken together, an increased permeability of the cuticle is closely associated with downregulation of genes involved in cuticular lipid synthesis in hypoxia-stressed Arabidopsis. The present study elucidates one of the cuticle-related adaptive responses that may allow plants to cope with low oxygen levels.},

Although broad trade-offs among leaf structural and physiological traits have been demonstrated, we still do not have a comprehensive view of the fundamental constraints underlying the LES trade-offs.


* Here, we investigated physiological and structural mechanisms underpinning the LES by analysing a novel data compilation incorporating rarely considered traits such as the dry mass fraction in cell walls, nitrogen allocation, mesophyll CO2 diffusion and associated anatomical traits for hundreds of species covering major growth forms.


* The analysis demonstrates that cell wall constituents are major components of leaf dry mass (18–70\%), especially in leaves with high leaf mass per unit area (LMA) and long lifespan. A greater fraction of leaf mass in cell walls is typically associated with a lower fraction of leaf nitrogen (N) invested in photosynthetic proteins; and lower within-leaf CO2 diffusion rates, as a result of thicker mesophyll cell walls.


* The costs associated with greater investments in cell walls underpin the LES: long leaf lifespans are achieved via higher LMA and in turn by higher cell wall mass fraction, but this inevitably reduces the efficiency of photosynthesis.},

Tropical relicts also persist in refugia in the arid interior while some spiders (both mygalomorphs and araneomorphs) have adapted to arid conditions, mainly through specialized behaviours. Although fire has become increasingly a phenomenon of the Australian environment it is doubtful whether any spiders are adapted to fire per se. European settlement has impacted differentially on relictual and later evolved representatives; a few species, including the funnelweb (Atraxrobustus) and redback spider (Latrodectus hasselti) have benefited through enhanced habitat opportunities and some species of Badumna and other genera have become synanthropic. It is suggested that conservation strategies need to consider the ecoevolutionary history of particular spiders and their natural vulnerability or resilience to environmental factors.},

	abstract = {Hyperspectral sensors are able to detect biological processes of plants which are invisible to the naked eye. Close-range cameras in particular support the identification of biotic and abiotic stress reactions at an early stage. Up to now, their full potential is only partially realized because geometrical factors as leaf angle, curvature and self-shading, overlay the signal of biological processes. Suitable 3D plant models constitutes an important step to removing these factors from the data. The matching of these 3D model and the hyperspectral image with sufficient accuracy even for small leaf veins is required but relies on an adequate geometric calibration of hyperspectral cameras.
We present a method for the geometric calibration of hyperspectral pushbroom cameras in the close-range, which enables reliable and reproducible results at sub-pixel scale. This approach extends the linear pushbroom camera by the ability to model non-linear fractions. Accuracy and reproducibility of the method is validated using a hyperspectral senor system with two line cameras observing the reflected radiation in the spectral range from 400 to 2500 nm. We point out new potentials arising from with the proposed camera calibration, e.g. hyperspectral 3D plant models, which have high potential for crop plant phenotyping.},

	abstract = {The main impacts of riparian vegetation on hydrological processes are briefly reviewed in order to highlight needs and perspectives for research and management goals. This review is based upon three distinct influences of riparian vegetation on hydrological processes: (i) the control of runoff, i.e. the physical impact of living and dead plants on hydraulics, (ii) the impact of plant physiology on water uptake, storage and return to the atmosphere, and (iii) the impact of riparian vegetation functioning on water quality. Riparian vegetation influences runoff through complex hydraulic interactions during baseflows as well as overbank flows. The contribution of fine vegetational structures to landscape hydrological roughness needs to be considered in relation to the spatial complexity (patchiness, vertical stratification, rhizosphere) and temporal variability (phenology, succession) of plant communities. With the exception of some woody species, the uptake, storage and return of water to the atmosphere is poorly known for riparian communities, and therefore the assessment of the regional hydrological importance of the riparian corridor remains difficult to estimate. Although better understood than the above two influences of riparian vegetation on hydrological processes, there are still a number of unresolved issues concerning the role of riparian vegetation in controlling water quality. In particular, little is known about the coupling of microbial and vegetational functions in nutrient cycling and the dynamics of carbon release from coarse and fine plant debris. The influence of vegetation complexity and plant diversity on both qualitative and quantitative aspects of water cycling remains an important area for future research. Fundamental and management issues are identified in relation to the use of riparian vegetation as a model and as a tool. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We characterized functional zones (with respect to vegetation development in association with various biogeochemical processes) within geomorphological settings using a delineation based upon erosional, transitional and depositional properties. 3. Vegetation dynamics within the riparian corridor are clearly influenced substantially by hydrological disturbance regimes. In turn, we suggest that vegetation productivity and diversity may widely influence riverine biogeochemical processes, especially as related to the consequences of changing redox conditions occurring from upstream to downstream. 4. However, surface and groundwater linkages are the predominant controls of landscape connectivity within riparian systems. 5. The importance of riparian zones as sources and sinks of matter and energy was examined in context of structural and functional attributes, such as sequestering or cycling of nutrients in sediments, retention of water in vegetation, and retention, diffusion or dispersal of biota. 6. The consequences of interactions between different communities (e.g. animals and plants, micro-organisms and plants) on biogeochemical processes are notably in need of research, especially with respect to control of landscape features. Multiscale approaches, coupling regional and local factors in all three spatial dimensions, are needed in order to understand more synthetically and to model biogeochemical and community processes within the river-riparian-upland landscape of catchments.},

This use will keep increasing with the support of new policies on land transfer and appropriately scaled operations for farming in the near future. A major agricultural application of UAS in China is plant protection, toward increasing pest and disease management efficiency. The advantages of UAS are apparent in the country, which has the largest number of small-sized farms in the world. UAS in China have advantages for farms in mountainous regions and orchard production, where it is difficult for ground-based machines to manoeuvre. Advances of UAS use in the country have created new challenges to the agricultural aviation industry in crop monitoring, pest sampling, pest detection, pest diagnosis and spraying technology. This article reviews the agricultural use of UAS in China, with a focus on plant protection. The challenges and prospects of UAS use in the country are also summarised.},

Test design considered a vineyard of Moscato Reale sited in Apulia (South-Eastern Italy) and two growing seasons (2013 and 2014). Comparisons concerned Landsat 8 OLI images and aerial datasets from airborne RedLake MS4100 multispectral camera. We firstly investigated the role of spatial resolution in radiometric features of data and, in particular, of NDVI maps and consequently of vigour maps. We first measured the maximum expected correlation between satellite- and aerial-derived maps. We found that, without any pixel selection and spatial interpolation, correlation ranges between 0.35 and 0.60 depending on the degree of heterogeneity of the vineyard. We also found that this result can be improved by operating a selection of those pixels representing vines canopy in aerial imagery and spatially interpolating them. In this way correlation coefficient can be improved up to 0.85 (minimum 0.60) suggesting an excellent capability of satellite data to approximate aerial ones at vineyard level. Prescription maps derived from vigour one demonstrated to be spatially consistent; but we also found that the quantitative interpretation of mapped vigour was changing in strength according to datasets and time of acquisition. Therefore, in spite of a satisfying consistency of spatial distribution, results showed that vigour strength at vineyard level from aerial and satellite datasets is generally not consistent, partially for the presence of a bias (that we modelled).},

	abstract = {Leaf area index (LAI) is an important indicator of plant growth and yield that can be monitored by remote sensing. Several models were constructed using datasets derived from SRS and STR sampling methods to determine the optimal model for soybean (multiple strains) LAI inversion for the whole crop growth period and a single growth period. Random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM) regression models were compared with a partial least-squares regression (PLS) model. The RF model yielded the highest precision, accuracy, and stability with V-R2, SDR2, V-RMSE, and SDRMSE values of 0.741, 0.031, 0.106, and 0.005, respectively, over the whole growth period based on STR sampling. The ANN model had the highest precision, accuracy, and stability (0.452, 0.132, 0.086, and 0.009, respectively) over a single growth phase based on STR sampling. The precision, accuracy, and stability of the RF, ANN, and SVM models were improved by inclusion of STR sampling. The RF model is suitable for estimating LAI when sample plots and variation are relatively large (i.e., the whole growth period or more than one growth period). The ANN model is more appropriate for estimating LAI when sample plots and variation are relatively low (i.e., a single growth period).},

	abstract = {In urban and industrial environments, the constant increase of impermeable surfaces has produced drastic changes in the natural hydrological cycle. Decreasing green areas not only produce negative effects from a hydrological-hydraulic perspective, but also from an energy point of view, modifying the urban microclimate and generating, as shown in the literature, heat islands in our cities. In this context, green infrastructures may represent an environmental compensation action that can be used to re-equilibrate the hydrological and energy balance and reduce the impact of pollutant load on receiving water bodies. To ensure that a green infrastructure will work properly, vegetated areas have to be continuously monitored to verify their health state. This paper presents a ground spectroscopy monitoring survey of a green roof installed at the University of Calabria fulfilled via the acquisition and analysis of hyperspectral data. This study is part of a larger research project financed by European Structural funds aimed at understanding the influence of green roofs on rainwater management and energy consumption for air conditioning in the Mediterranean area. Reflectance values were acquired with a field-portable spectroradiometer that operates in the range of wavelengths 350–2500 nm. The survey was carried out during the time period November 2014–June 2015 and data were acquired weekly. Climatic, thermo-physical, hydrological and hydraulic quantities were acquired as well and related to spectral data. Broadband and narrowband spectral indices, related to chlorophyll content and to chlorophyll–carotenoid ratio, were computed. The two narrowband indices NDVI705 and SIPI turned out to be the most representative indices to detect the plant health status.},

Second, we compare PhD students to three other samples: (1) highly educated in the general population (N = 769); (2) highly educated employees (N = 592); and (3) higher education students (N = 333). Third, we assess those organizational factors relating to the role of PhD students that predict mental health status. Results based on 12 mental health symptoms (GHQ-12) showed that 32\% of PhD students are at risk of having or developing a common psychiatric disorder, especially depression. This estimate was significantly higher than those obtained in the comparison groups. Organizational policies were significantly associated with the prevalence of mental health problems. Especially work-family interface, job demands and job control, the supervisor’s leadership style, team decision-making culture, and perception of a career outside academia are linked to mental health problems.},

For a suite of 18 sympatric clover species (Trifolium and Medicago, Fabaceae), we evaluated leaf traits affecting leaf wetness and susceptibility to infection by the fungal pathogen Stemphylium sp., causal agent of Stemphylium leaf spot. Spore germination increased with time in free water, and the relative susceptibility of host plants to infection was proportional to the duration of water retention on leaves. Larger leaves captured more water and retained it longer. Unexpectedly, trichomes and leaf wettability did not affect water capture. For clovers planted within natural clover populations at two sites, infection was threefold greater at the wetter site. At the drier site, water retention on the leaf surface was an important predictor of infection rates across host species, but persistent fog and dew at the wetter site reduced the importance of rapid leaf drying. Our results suggest that plant adaptations that reduce water retention on leaves may also reduce disease incidence, but the selective advantage of these traits will vary among habitats.},

	abstract = {This review focuses on the role of two distinct fitness strategies in the growth, survival, and epidemiology of foliar bacterial pathogens. A tolerance strategy requires the ability to tolerate direct exposure to environmental stresses on leaf surfaces, including UV radiation and low water availability. An avoidance strategy requires the ability to seek and/or exploit sites that are protected from these stresses, including endophytic sites. The ability to employ an avoidance strategy and grow endophytically may directly influence the potential for pathogenesis, since endophytic populations, not epiphytic populations, are likely responsible for disease induction. Furthermore, exchange between these two populations is probably crucial to the epidemiology of foliar pathogens. While foliar pathogens can grow and survive in both exposed and internal sites, indicating that they can employ both fitness strategies, the poor internal growth of most saprophytes suggests that saprophytes depend primarily on a strategy of tolerance. This difference between pathogens and saprophytes has important implications for predicting the population dynamics of leaf-associated bacterial species and for selecting effective biological control agents.},

In the present study, we examined genetic correlations between leaf surface traits (glandular trichome density and total concentrations of surface flavonoid aglycones) and occurrence of three species of foliar micro-fungi, one pathogenic rust (Melampsoridium betulinum) and two endophytic fungi (Fusicladium sp. and Melanconium sp.), and performance of autumnal moth larvae (Epirrita autumnata) in two birch species, Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii and B. pendula. The performance of autumnal moth larvae on B. pubescens ssp. czerepanovii was negatively correlated with density of glandular trichomes (RGR: r=−0.855; pupal mass: r=−0.709). In addition, rust infection was negatively correlated with trichome density in B. pendula (r=−0.675) and with epicuticular flavonoid aglycones in B. pubescens ssp. czerepanovii (r=−0.855). The frequency of the endophytic fungus Fusicladium sp., was related to epicuticular flavonoid aglycones (r=−0.782), while another endophytic fungus, Melanconium sp., showed no associations with any of the studied variables in B. pubescens ssp. czerepanovii. Our results indicate that leaf surface traits may be at least as important determinants of herbivore performance and micro-fungi abundance in birch as leaf internal chemistry.},

Saprophytic fungi obtain water and nutrients from these surfaces and the leaf surface provides a physical environment suitable for growth and reproduction. For phytopathogenic fungi, the leaf surface represents a temporary, supportive environment, but a surface that must be breached before a successful pathogenic interaction can become established. Thus, the physical and chemical characteristics of the leaf surface play an important role in governing the success or failure of fungal growth on, and subsequently in, the leaf. Numerous reviews have been written about the growth of fungi in association with plant surfaces (e.g., Preece, 1976; Aist, 1981; Wynn, 1981; Staples and Macko, 1984; Hoch and Staples, 1987, 1991). This chapter focuses on features of the leaf surface as they influence the establishment and growth of various fungi. Attention will be given to the time and place of initial spore deposition on the leaf, to growth over the surface, and in the case of pathogenic fungi, to their penetration into the leaf. Since the authors’ research experience lies in the growth and development of rust fungi, considerable emphasis will be placed on examples involving these organisms.},

In the present study, leaf trichomes appeared to have a strong influence on leaf water repellency (i.e. degree of water droplet formation on the leaf surface) as well as the retention of droplets on the leaf. Based upon evaluation of 38 plant species from 21 families, we found that leaves with trichomes were more water repellent, especially where trichome density was greater than 25mm2. However, droplet repellency and retention were both high in some species where trichomes entrapped droplets. Finally, the lensing effects of water droplets on leaf surfaces increased incident sunlight by over 20-fold directly beneath individual droplets. These results may have important implications for such processes as stomatal function, whole leaf photosynthesis, and transpiration for a large variety of plant species.},

Potential incident solar radiation (insolation) was estimated from a geographic information system to quantify microclimate affinities of these species across north- and south-facing slopes. At the community level, leaf size and SLA both declined with increasing insolation, based on average trait values for the species found in plots along the gradient. However, leaf size and SLA were not significantly correlated across species, suggesting that these two traits are decoupled and associated with different aspects of performance along this environmental gradient. For individual species, SLA was negatively correlated with species distributions along the insolation gradient, and was significantly lower in evergreen versus deciduous species. Leaf size exhibited a negative but non-significant trend in relation to insolation distribution of individual species. At the community level, variance in leaf size increased with increasing insolation. For individual species, there was a greater range of leaf size on south-facing slopes, while there was an absence of small-leaved species on north-facing slopes. These results demonstrate that analyses of plant functional traits along environmental gradients based on community level averages may obscure important aspects of trait variation and distribution among the constituent species.},

	abstract = {Variation in leaf life—span has long been considered of ecological significance.Despite this, quantitative evaluation of the relationships between leaf life—span and other plant and ecosystem characteristics has been rare. In this paper we ask whether leaf life—span is related to other leaf, plant, and stand traits of species from diverse ecosystems and biomes. We also examine the interaction between leaf, plant, and stand traits and their relation to productivity and ecological patterns. Among all species, both mass— (Amass) and area—based (Aarea) maximum net photosynthesis decreased with increasing leaf life—span, but the relationship was stronger on a mass (P {\textless}.001, r2 = 0.70) than an area (P {\textless}.05, r2 = 0.24) basis. Similarly, mass—based leaf nitrogen (leaf Nmass) decreased (P {\textless}.001, r2 = 0.52) with leaf life—span, but area—based leaf N (leaf Narea) did not (P {\textgreater}.25, r2 = 0.01). Specific leaf area (SLA, leaf area/leaf dry mass) and leaf diffusive conductance also decreased with increasing leaf life—span. Decreasing Amass with increasing leaf life—span results from the impact of decreasing Nmass and SLA on Amass. Variation in leaf traits as a function of leaf life—span was similar for broad—leaved and needle—leaved subsets of the data. These leaf—scale data from several biomes were compared to a data set from a single biome, Amazonia. For several leaf traits (e.g., SLA, Nmass, and Amass) the quantitative relationship with leaf life—span was similar in the two independent data sets, suggesting that these are fundamental relations applicable to all species. Amass was a linear function of Nmass (P .001, r2 = 0.74) with a regression similar to previous analyses, while Aarea was not significantly related to Narea. These results suggest that the photosynthesis—leaf N relationship among species should be considered universal when expressed on a mass, but not on a leaf area, basis. Relative growth rates (RGR) and leaf area ratio (LAR, the whole—plant ratio of leaf area to total dry mass) of seedlings decreased with increasing leaf life—span (P {\textless} .001, r2 = 0.61 and 0.89, respectively). LAR was positively related to both RGR and Amass (r2 = 0.68 and 0.84, respectively), and Amass and RGR were also positively related (r2 = 0.55). Absolute height growth rates of young trees decreased with increasing leaf life—span (P {\textless} .001, r2 = 0.72) and increased with Amass (P {\textless} .001, r2 = 0.78). It appears that a suite of traits including short leaf life—span and high leaf Nmass, SLA, LAR, and Amass interactively contribute to high growth rates in open—grown individuals. These traits interact similarly at the stand level, but stands differ from individuals in one key trait. In closed—canopy forests, species with longer lived foliage (and low LAR as seedlings) have greater foliage mass per unit ground area (P {\textless} .001, r2 = 0.74) and a greater proportion of total mass in foliage. The aboveground production efficiency (ANPP/foliar biomass) of forest stands decreased markedly with increasing leaf life—span or total foliage mass (P {\textless} .001, r2 = 0.78 and 0.72, respectively), probably as a result of decreasing Amass, Nmass, and SLA, all of which were positively related with production efficiency and negatively related to total foliage mass. However, high foliage mass of species with extended leaf life—spans appears to compensate for low production per unit foliage, since aboveground net primary production (ANPP, in megagrams per hectare per year) of forest stands was not related to leaf life—span. Extended leaf life—span also appears to compensate for lower potential production per unit leaf N per unit time, with the result that stand—level N use efficiency is weakly positively related to leaf life—span. We hypothesize that co—variation among species in leaf life—span, SLA, leaf Nmass, Amass, and growth rate reflects a set of mutually supporting traits that interact to determine plant behavior and production, and provide a useful conceptual link between processes at short—term leaf scales and longer term whole plant and stand—level scales. Although this paper has focused on leaf life—span, this trait is so closely interrelated with several others that this cohort of leaf traits should be viewed as casually interrelated. Generality in the relationships between leaf life—span and other plant traits across diverse communities and ecosystems suggests that they are universal in nature and thus can provide a quantitative link and/or common currency for ecological comparisons among diverse systems.},

Leaf life span (LL) and leaf mass per area (LMA) are fundamental traits in the carbon economy of plants, representing the investment required per unit leaf area (LMA) and the duration of the resulting benefit (LL). Species on dry and infertile soils converge towards higher LMA. It has been generally assumed that this allows species from low-resource habitats to achieve longer average leaf life spans, as LMA and LL are often correlated.


*
2
Leaf life span and LMA were measured for 75 perennial species from eastern Australia. Species were sampled from nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor sites within high and low rainfall regions. LL and LMA were positively correlated across species within each site. In addition, evolutionary divergences in LL and LMA were correlated within each site, indicating that cross-species relationships were not simply driven by differences between higher taxonomic groups.


*
3
Within a rainfall zone, LL–LMA combinations shifted as expected along common axes of variation such that species on poorer soils had higher LMA and longer LL, but significantly so only at high rainfall.


*
4
Low rainfall species were expected to have shorter LL at a given LMA or, equally, require higher LMA to achieve a given LL, i.e. shift to a parallel axis of variation, and this was observed on both nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor soils. On average, 30\% higher LMA was seemingly required at dry sites to achieve a given LL. Thus, convergence towards higher LMA has different consequences for leaf life span in dry and nutrient-poor habitats.


*
5
The broad shifts in LL–LMA combinations between site types were also seen when comparing closely related species-pairs (phylogenetically independent contrasts) occurring on nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor soils (within each rainfall zone), and at high- and low-rainfall sites (at each soil nutrient level).},

Our results thus demonstrate convergent evolution and global generality in plant functioning, despite the enormous diversity of plant species and biomes. For 280 plant species from two global data sets, we found that potential carbon gain (photosynthesis) and carbon loss (respiration) increase in similar proportion with decreasing leaf life-span, increasing leaf nitrogen concentration, and increasing leaf surface area-to-mass ratio. Productivity of individual plants and of leaves in vegetation canopies also changes in constant proportion to leaf life-span and surface area-to-mass ratio. These global plant functional relationships have significant implications for global scale modeling of vegetation–atmosphere CO2 exchange.},

Eradication attempts often involve removal of host plants within a certain radius of detection, targeting asymptomatic infection. Here we develop and test potentially more effective, epidemiologically motivated, control strategies, using a mathematical model previously fitted to the spread of citrus canker in Florida.


* We test risk-based control, which preferentially removes hosts expected to cause a high number of infections in the remaining host population. Removals then depend on past patterns of pathogen spread and host removal, which might be nontransparent to affected stakeholders. This motivates a variable radius strategy, which approximates risk-based control via removal radii that vary by location, but which are fixed in advance of any epidemic.


* Risk-based control outperforms variable radius control, which in turn outperforms constant radius removal. This result is robust to changes in disease spread parameters and initial patterns of susceptible host plants. However, efficiency degrades if epidemiological parameters are incorrectly characterised.


* Risk-based control including additional epidemiology can be used to improve disease management, but it requires good prior knowledge for optimal performance.

Many modern groups contain sister taxa that have disjunct transoceanic distributions, which can be interpreted as a result of either vicariance or long-distance dispersal and establishment (LDDE). Further, some Myrtaceae groups occur on Pacific islands with enigmatic geological histories. We tested hypotheses of vicariance and LDDE by estimating divergence times using a relaxed molecular clock calibrated with 12 fossils. In total, 88 genera and 202 species were sampled, representing both subfamilies and all tribes of Myrtaceae. We reconstructed the family as Gondwanan in origin. Of the 22 geographically disjunct sister groups in our study, up to six are potentially explained as the product of vicariance, three resulting from overland dispersal via new land connections, and 13 due to LDDE events. Nine of the 13 hypothesized LDDE events occurred in fleshy-fruited taxa. Our results indicate that most of the transoceanic distribution patterns in Myrtaceae have occurred since the Miocene due to LDDE, whereas inferred vicariance events all occurred before the Late Eocene. There are many instances of sister relationships between species-poor and species-rich groups in Myrtaceae, and at least three occurrences of geographically isolated taxa on long branches of the phylogeny (Arillastrum, Myrtus, and Tepualia), whose modern-day distributions are difficult to explain without additional fossil or geological evidence.},

However, when analysing data derived from accelerometers, there are many statistical techniques available which when applied to different data sets produce different classification accuracies. We investigated a selection of supervised machine learning methods for interpreting behavioural data from captive otariids (fur seals and sea lions). We conducted controlled experiments with 12 seals, where their behaviours were filmed while they were wearing 3-axis accelerometers. From video we identified 26 behaviours that could be grouped into one of four categories (foraging, resting, travelling and grooming) representing key behaviour states for wild seals. We used data from 10 seals to train four predictive classification models: stochastic gradient boosting (GBM), random forests, support vector machine using four different kernels and a baseline model: penalised logistic regression. We then took the best parameters from each model and cross-validated the results on the two seals unseen so far. We also investigated the influence of feature statistics (describing some characteristic of the seal), testing the models both with and without these. Cross-validation accuracies were lower than training accuracy, but the SVM with a polynomial kernel was still able to classify seal behaviour with high accuracy ({\textgreater}70\%). Adding feature statistics improved accuracies across all models tested. Most categories of behaviour -resting, grooming and feeding—were all predicted with reasonable accuracy (52–81\%) by the SVM while travelling was poorly categorised (31–41\%). These results show that model selection is important when classifying behaviour and that by using animal characteristics we can strengthen the overall accuracy.},

Abstract
Leaf mechanical properties strongly influence leaf lifespan, plant–herbivore interactions, litter decomposition and nutrient cycling, but global patterns in their interspecific variation and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We synthesize data across the three major measurement methods, permitting the first global analyses of leaf mechanics and associated traits, for 2819 species from 90 sites worldwide. Key measures of leaf mechanical resistance varied c. 500–800-fold among species. Contrary to a long-standing hypothesis, tropical leaves were not mechanically more resistant than temperate leaves. Leaf mechanical resistance was modestly related to rainfall and local light environment. By partitioning leaf mechanical resistance into three different components we discovered that toughness per density contributed a surprisingly large fraction to variation in mechanical resistance, larger than the fractions contributed by lamina thickness and tissue density. Higher toughness per density was associated with long leaf lifespan especially in forest understory. Seldom appreciated in the past, toughness per density is a key factor in leaf mechanical resistance, which itself influences plant–animal interactions and ecosystem functions across the globe.},

Leaf thickness and toughness were related closely to LMA, while DMC and LMA were only marginally correlated.

Several studies have been conducted to find stress-specific signatures or stress-independent commonalities. Previously this has been done by comparing different single stress treatments. This approach has been proven difficult since most studies, comparing single and combined stress conditions, came to the conclusion that each stress treatment results in specific transcriptional changes. Although transcriptional changes at the level of individual genes are highly variable and stress-specific, central metabolic and signaling responses seem to be common, often leading to an overall reduced plant growth. Understanding how specific transcriptional changes are linked to stress adaptations and identifying central hubs controlling this interaction will be the challenge for the coming years. In this review, we will summarize current knowledge on plant responses to different individual and combined stresses and try to find a common thread potentially underlying these responses. We will begin with a brief summary of known physiological, metabolic, transcriptional and hormonal responses to individual stresses, elucidate potential commonalities and conflicts and finally we will describe results obtained during combined stress experiments. Here we will concentrate on simultaneous application of stress conditions but we will also touch consequences of sequential stress treatments. This article is protected by copyright.

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide a new research tool to obtain high spatial and temporal resolution imagery at a reduced cost. Rapid advances in miniature sensor technology are leading to greater potentials for ecological research. We demonstrate one of the first applications of UAV lidar and hyperspectral imagery and a fusion method for individual plant species identification and 3D characterization at submeter scales in south-eastern Arizona, USA. The UAV lidar scanner characterized the individual vegetation canopy structure and bare ground elevation, whereas the hyperspectral sensor provided species-specific spectral signatures for the dominant and target species at our study area in leaf-on condition. We hypothesized that the fusion of the two different data sources would perform better than either data type alone in the arid and semi-arid ecosystems with sparse vegetation. The fusion approach provides 84–89\% overall accuracy (kappa values of 0.80–0.86) in target species classification at the canopy scale, leveraging a wide range of target spectral responses in the hyperspectral data and a high point density (50 points/m2) in the lidar data. In comparison, the hyperspectral image classification alone produced 72–76\% overall accuracies (kappa values of 0.70 and 0.71). The UAV lidar-derived digital elevation model (DEM) is also strongly correlated with manned airborne lidar-derived DEM (R2 = 0.98 and 0.96), but was obtained at a lower cost. The lidar and hyperspectral data as well as the fusion method demonstrated here can be widely applied across a gradient of vegetation and topography to monitor and detect ecological changes at a local scale.},

	abstract = {Leaf hydrophobicity and water droplet retention are important functional traits among plant species and may be important selective strategies to increase water availability to root systems in arid and semi-arid environments. Hydrophobic canopies may decrease rainfall interception and increase throughfall to the soil. Leaf angle may also influence the ability of water droplets to channel off leaf surfaces. Water droplets may have a greater ability to drain off leaf surfaces with steeper leaf angles which decrease rainfall interception and increase throughfall to the soil. This study examined the relationships between leaf angle, leaf hydrophobicity, and water droplet retention in 11 species from a semi-arid region of Colorado in the western United States. Leaf hydrophobicity of the adaxial and the abaxial leaf surface was measured by calculating the contact angle between a water droplet and the leaf surface. Water droplet retention was measured as the angle at which a water droplet begins to move as a leaf is incrementally tilted from 0° to 90°. Leaf hydrophobicity was greater than leaf angle for 9 species and similar for 2 species. Leaf angle was greater than water droplet retention on the adaxial leaf surface for 8 species and similar for 3 species. Leaf angle was greater than water droplet retention on the abaxial leaf surface for 7 species and similar for 2 species. The relationship between leaf angle and leaf hydrophobicity and the relationship between leaf angle and water droplet retention were weak; however, the relationship between leaf hydrophobicity and water droplet retention was stronger. Results indicate that intercepted water droplets during a rainfall event will likely drain off the leaf surfaces from a majority of the species examined and contribute to throughfall because leaf angle is greater than water droplet retention in these species. The relationship between leaf angle and canopy hydrophobicity may be a significant influence on hydrological processes in arid and semi-arid regions.},

These stress treatments led to increases in cuticular wax amount per unit area of 32\% to 80\%, due primarily to 29\% to 98\% increases in wax alkanes. Of these treatments, only water deficit increased the total cutin monomer amount (by 65\%), whereas both water deficit and NaCl altered the proportional amounts of cutin monomers. Abscisic acid had little effect on cutin composition. Water deficit, but not NaCl, increased leaf cuticle thickness (by 49\%). Electron micrographs revealed that both water-deprived and NaCl-treated plants had elevated osmium accumulation in their cuticles. The abundance of cuticle-associated gene transcripts in leaves was altered by all treatments, including those performed in both pot-grown and in vitro conditions. Notably, the abundance of the ECERIFERUM1 gene transcript, predicted to function in alkane synthesis, was highly induced by all treatments, results consistent with the elevated alkane amounts observed in all treatments. Further, this induction of cuticle lipids was associated with reduced cuticle permeability and may be important for plant acclimation to subsequent water-limited conditions. Taken together, these results show that Arabidopsis provides an excellent model system to study the role of the cuticle in plant response to drought and related stresses, and its associated genetic and cellular regulation.},

	abstract = {Insertional mutagenesis of Arabidopsis ecotype C24 was used to identify a novel mutant, designated wax2, that had alterations in both cuticle membrane and cuticular waxes. Arabidopsis mutants with altered cuticle membrane have not been reported previously. Compared with the wild type, the cuticle membrane of wax2 stems weighed 20.2\% less, and when viewed using electron microscopy, it was 36.4\% thicker, less opaque, and structurally disorganized. The total wax amount on wax2 leaves and stems was reduced by {\textgreater}78\% and showed proportional deficiencies in the aldehydes, alkanes, secondary alcohols, and ketones, with increased acids, primary alcohols, and esters. Besides altered cuticle membranes, wax2 displayed postgenital fusion between aerial organs (especially in flower buds), reduced fertility under low humidity, increased epidermal permeability, and a reduction in stomatal index on adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces. Thus, wax2 reveals a potential role for the cuticle as a suppressor of postgenital fusion and epidermal diffusion and as a mediator of both fertility and the development of epidermal architecture (via effects on stomatal index). The cloned WAX2 gene (verified by three independent allelic insertion mutants with identical phenotypes) codes for a predicted 632–amino acid integral membrane protein with a molecular mass of 72.3 kD and a theoretical pI of 8.78. WAX2 has six transmembrane domains, a His-rich diiron binding region at the N-terminal region, and a large soluble C-terminal domain. The N-terminal portion of WAX2 is homologous with members of the sterol desaturase family, whereas the C terminus of WAX2 is most similar to members of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family. WAX2 has 32\% identity to CER1, a protein required for wax production but not for cuticle membrane production. Based on these analyses, we predict that WAX2 has a metabolic function associated with both cuticle membrane and wax synthesis. These studies provide new insight into the genetics and biochemistry of plant cuticle production and elucidate new associations between the cuticle and diverse aspects of plant development.},

Analysis of variance is particularly powerful for the analysis of univariate data. The traditional multivariate analogues, however, are too stringent in their assumptions for most ecological multivariate data sets. Non-parametric methods, based on permutation tests, are preferable. This paper describes a new non-parametric method for multivariate analysis of variance, after McArdle and Anderson (in press). It is given here, with several applications in ecology, to provide an alternative and perhaps more intuitive formulation for ANOVA (based on sums of squared distances) to complement the description provided by McArdle and Anderson (in press) for the analysis of any linear model. It is an improvement on previous non-parametric methods because it allows a direct additive partitioning of variation for complex models. It does this while maintaining the flexibility and lack of formal assumptions of other non-parametric methods. The test-statistic is a multivariate analogue to Fisher’s F-ratio and is calculated directly from any symmetric distance or dissimilarity matrix. P-values are then obtained using permutations. Some examples of the method are given for tests involving several factors, including factorial and hierarchical (nested) designs and tests of interactions.},

However, there is growing recognition that leaf wetting can have positive effects.


* We measured variation in two traits, leaf drip tips and leaf water repellency, in a series of nine tropical forest communities occurring along a 3300-m elevation gradient in southern Peru. To extend this climatic gradient, we also assembled published leaf water repellency values from 17 additional sites. We then tested hypotheses for how these traits should vary as a function of climate.


* Contrary to expectations, we found that the proportion of species with drip tips did not increase with increasing precipitation. Instead, drip tips increased with increasing temperature. Moreover, leaf water repellency was very low in our sites and the global analysis indicated high repellency only in sites with low precipitation and temperatures.


* Our findings suggest that drip tips and repellency may not solely reflect the negative effects of wetting on plant function. Understanding the drivers of leaf wettability traits can provide insight into the effects of leaf wetting on plant, community, and ecosystem function.},

	abstract = {Numerous studies in materials science and chemistry have expanded our understanding of the repellency of water droplets from surfaces. Much of the inspiration for the development of synthetic water-repellent materials came from the examination of water-repellent properties of animals and plants in the natural environment. The hydrological significance of water repellency in the natural environment remains an underexplored research topic. Although the hydrological significance of soil water repellency has become well established in the ecohydrology and water resources literature, fewer studies have examined the significance of leaf water repellency. This review examines the properties of leaf water repellency, the methodologies used to calculate leaf water repellency, the leaf surface properties that promote leaf water repellency, and the significance of leaf water repellency in ecohydrological research. The repellency of a water droplet by a leaf surface is functionally important among plant species and may reflect selective strategies that either favour leaf water uptake in drought-prone environments or promote higher photosynthetic efficiency during prolonged periods of precipitation through higher repellency. Information on the functional significance of leaf water repellency in hydrologic models could enhance our understanding of the delivery of water resources to municipal reservoirs and fill in a missing gap in our understanding of leaf water repellency as a process that influences discharge, and by extension, water resources.

, and tissue toughness) to LL and LMA across the same suite of species. W
shear
is the work required to cut a leaf with a blade; W
shear divided by leaf thickness gives tissue toughness.
* • Low- and high-rainfall species did not differ in their LL at a given W shear
, but dry-site species had lower W
shear at a given LMA, leading to the observed LL – LMA shift with rainfall. These patterns were driven by 50\% lower tissue toughness in dry-site species.
* • The lower toughness was linked with high leaf N concentration, which is known to enhance water conservation during photosynthesis in low-rainfall species. Our results suggest that a significant cost of this strategy is reduced LL for a given investment in leaf tissue (LMA).},

The mobility and behavioral plasticity of large endothermic mammals, however, complicate the detection of climatic effects on their spatial distributions. Here, we analyzed 230,565 hunting locations of the four most abundant ungulate species in the European Alps: ibex, chamois, red deer, and roe deer. Year-to-year and inter-decadal range shifts toward higher elevations in Switzerland coincided with warmer, snow-free, and thus more favorable autumn conditions in the same area. The average harvest elevation of ibex, chamois, and red deer significantly increased between 1991 and 2013. Although this trend is anticipated to continue, behavioral plasticity may allow the Alpine ibex and other mountain ungulates to buffer some of the associated consequences of climate change. Our results demonstrate the utility of well-replicated hunting archives to supplement shorter but more precise monitoring data. This study also provides independent evidence of animal range shifts in response to environmental change at interannual and multi-decadal time-scales.},

A statistic U depending on the relative ranks of the x's and y's is proposed for testing the hypothesis f = g. Wilcoxon proposed an equivalent test in the Biometrics Bulletin, December, 1945, but gave only a few points of the distribution of his statistic. Under the hypothesis f = g the probability of obtaining a given U in a sample of n x's and m y's is the solution of a certain recurrence relation involving n and m. Using this recurrence relation tables have been computed giving the probability of U for samples up to n = m = 8. At this point the distribution is almost normal. From the recurrence relation explicit expressions for the mean, variance, and fourth moment are obtained. The 2rth moment is shown to have a certain form which enabled us to prove that the limit distribution is normal if m, n go to infinity in any arbitrary manner. The test is shown to be consistent with respect to the class of alternatives \$f(x) {\textgreater} g(x)\$ for every x.},

	abstract = {At moderate to high leaf area index (values 3–5), many ratio-based vegetation indices, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), reach an asymptote where the linear relationship between leaf area index and vegetation index value breaks down. The red and near infrared channels are used to calculate most ratio vegetation indices when using sensors such as Landsat; however, these channels sense very different depths in vegetation canopies due to differences in transmittance, which may explain this breakdown of vegetation indices. In laboratory-simulated canopies composed of four deciduous species, visible wavelengths (∼400–700 nm) were mostly attenuated by the first or second leaf layer, while near infrared wavelengths were substantially transmitted beyond the sixth or seventh leaf layer. Absolute changes in reflectance {\textgreater}1\% were seen in some canopies up to four leaf layers thick in the near infrared wavelengths. Therefore, in natural canopies, near infrared wavelengths have a greater probability of penetrating to the soil/litter background than visible wavelengths, which may impact vegetation indices that use both visible and near infrared wavelengths for canopies between two and seven layers thick. While this was a preliminary study that isolated the canopy depth variable, polynomial regression analysis showed that differences in canopy thickness explained most of the observed variability in canopy reflectance. These results will facilitate the development and assessment of spectral vegetation indices that would probe canopies to consistent depths.},

The objective of work was to obtain parameters for classification of paddy soils using spectral data obtained by diffuse spectroradiometry. The surface and subsurface soil samples were collected by using a 90 m2 sampling grid with equidistant points. Spectral analysis was performed in a laboratory by using a spectroradiometer with 1 nm resolution at 350–1100 nm and 2 nm resolution at 1100–2500 nm. The evaluation of spectral curves was performed on the basis of four different procedures. The statistical analysis was performed by using the procedures STEPDISC, STEPWISE, and DISCRIM of Statistical Analysis System (SAS) software. The results show that soil discriminations by the spectral data obtained in the laboratory were successful. However, the model that tests the procedure for soil discrimination has low accuracy of 47.79\% when compared with other methods.},

Stepwise multiple regression analyses have been performed on reflectance, transmittance, and absorptance values (individual leaves) as well as on reflectance values of optically thick samples (stacked leaves + needles), on measured values and on transformations of them such as the first derivative or the logarithm of the reciprocal of the reflectance. They underscored good prediction performances for protein, cellulose, and lignin with high squared multiple correlation coefficients (r2) values. Starch, whose concentration in the leaf was smaller compared to the other components, was estimated with less accuracy. As expected, dry material and optically thick samples provided respectively stronger correlations than fresh material and individual leaves.},

It is shown that the different epidermal structures influence the absorption of solar radiation only to a very small degree.The amount of absorbed solar energy is nearly equal for all plants investigated and therefore one must deduce that both epidermis types are, in respect to solar energy input, of the same adaptive value for the plant.},

	abstract = {In multivariate PLS (partial least square projection to latent structures) and PC (principal component) models with many variables, plots and lists of b loadings, coefficients, VIPs, etc. become messy and results are difficult to interpret. There is then a strong temptation to reduce the variables to a smaller, more manageable number. This reduction of variables, however, often removes information, makes the interpretation misleading and seriously increases the risk of spurious models. A better alternative is often to divide the variables into conceptually meaningful blocks and then apply hierarchical multiblock PLS (or PC) models. This blocking leads to two model levels: the upper level where the relationships between blocks are modelled and the lower level showing the details of each block. On each level, ‘standard’ PLS or PC scores and loading plots are available for model interpretation. This allows an interpretation focused on pertinent blocks and their dominant variables. Such blocking is natural and straightforward in spectroscopy (multivariate calibration), quantitative molecular modelling (e.g. CoMFA) and process modelling. The principles of hierarchical multivariate PLS and PC modelling are reviewed, some problems with variable selection are discussed and the approach is illustrated for a data set with around 300 variables and 500 observations taken from a residue catalytic cracker (RCCU) at the Statoil Mongstad refinery in Norway. © 1996 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The present study suggests a methodology to investigate the relationships between high-resolution multispectral images (0.05 m/pixel) acquired using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), and GLSD foliar symptoms monitored by ground surveys. This approach showed high correlation between Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) acquired by the UAV and GLSD symptoms, and discrimination between symptomatic from asymptomatic plants. High-resolution multispectral images were acquired during June and July of 2012 and 2013, in an experimental vineyard heavily affected by GLSD, located in Tuscany (Italy), where vines had been surveyed and mapped since 2003. Each vine was located with a global positioning system, and classified for appearance of foliar symptoms and disease severity at weekly intervals from the beginning of each season. Remote sensing and ground observation data were analyzed to promptly identify the early stages of disease, even before visual detection. This work suggests an innovative methodology for quantitative and qualitative analysis of spatial distribution of symptomatic plants. The system may also be used for exploring the physiological bases of GLSD, and predicting the onset of this disease.},

This review summarizes results from Arabidopsis-pathogen systems regarding the contributions of various defense responses to resistance to several biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens.

	abstract = {The amount of trichomes on the leaves of Metrosideros polymorpha varies enormously, ranging from 0 to ca 150 g/m2 across environmental gradients on the island of Hawaii. Pubescent individuals are abundant in dry areas or on young lava flows, whereas glabrous individuals are abundant in wet areas or on developed soils. To understand the adaptive advantages of pubescent individuals in arid environments, we addressed the following questions: (1) whether leaf trichomes increase the boundary layer resistance to gas diffusion, which in turn reduces the transpiration rate and increases water-use efficiency (WUE); and (2) whether pubescent individuals have other associated leaf and shoot traits that have adaptive significance in arid environments. We made detailed ecophysiological measurements on M. polymorpha in three populations in habitats that varied in aridity. We found a large allocation of leaf mass to trichomes, up to 33 percent at the arid site, but our analyses showed that trichomes had small effects (1–9\%) on gas exchange and negligible effects on WUE, suggesting the trichomes may have roles beyond increasing WUE. However, pubescent individuals did have higher Rubisco amount and a lower leaf-to- sapwood area ratio, which are considered adaptive in arid environments. These results suggest that pubescent individuals of M. polymorpha are indeed adapted to arid environments with changes in a suite of traits. The adaptive significance of the enormous variation in amounts of trichomes remains unclear and may be related to functions other than increasing boundary layer resistance.},

	abstract = {Early flowering plants are thought to have been woody species restricted to warm habitats. This lineage has since radiated into almost every climate, with manifold growth forms. As angiosperms spread and climate changed, they evolved mechanisms to cope with episodic freezing. To explore the evolution of traits underpinning the ability to persist in freezing conditions, we assembled a large species-level database of growth habit (woody or herbaceous; 49,064 species), as well as leaf phenology (evergreen or deciduous), diameter of hydraulic conduits (that is, xylem vessels and tracheids) and climate occupancies (exposure to freezing). To model the evolution of species/' traits and climate occupancies, we combined these data with an unparalleled dated molecular phylogeny (32,223 species) for land plants. Here we show that woody clades successfully moved into freezing-prone environments by either possessing transport networks of small safe conduits and/or shutting down hydraulic function by dropping leaves during freezing. Herbaceous species largely avoided freezing periods by senescing cheaply constructed aboveground tissue. Growth habit has long been considered labile, but we find that growth habit was less labile than climate occupancy. Additionally, freezing environments were largely filled by lineages that had already become herbs or, when remaining woody, already had small conduits (that is, the trait evolved before the climate occupancy). By contrast, most deciduous woody lineages had an evolutionary shift to seasonally shedding their leaves only after exposure to freezing (that is, the climate occupancy evolved before the trait). For angiosperms to inhabit novel cold environments they had to gain new structural and functional trait solutions; our results suggest that many of these solutions were probably acquired before their foray into the cold.},

	abstract = {In this study we attempt to identify the most suitable spectral bands to discriminate among wheat and oat crops using field hyperspectral remote sensing. Discrimination of these crops using ordinary aerial or multispectral satellite imagery can be challenging. Even though multispectral images could have a high spatial resolution, their few wide spectral bands hinder crop discrimination. Therefore, both high spatial resolution and spectral resolution are necessary to accurately discriminate between visually similar crops. One field each of oats and spring wheat, each at least 10 acres in size, was selected in southeastern Wisconsin. Biweekly spectral readings were taken using a spectroradiometer during the growing season from May to July. In each field, seven 10 m x 10 m quadrants were randomly placed and in each quadrants five points were selected from which 20 radiometric readings were taken. Radiometric measurements taken at each sampling point were averaged to derive a single reflectance curve per sampling date, covering the spectral range of 300 nm to 2,500 nm. Each spectral curve was divided into hyperspectral bands each 3 nm wide. The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to estimate how separable the two crops were. Results show that selected regions of the visible light and infrared radiation spectrum have the potential to discriminate between these crops. Crop discrimination is one of the first steps to support crop monitoring and agricultural surveys efforts.},

The identifying relevance of a feature or feature set is an important task for designing an effective classification scheme. Here, an ensemble of random forests (RF) classifiers is realized on the basis of relevance of features. Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS) was utilized to assess the relevance of a subset of features by studying the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them. Predictability of RF was greatly improved by random selection of the relevant features in each of the splits. An investigation was carried out on different types of images from the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (Landsat ETM+) and QuickBird sensors. It has been observed that the performance of the RF classifier was significantly improved while using the optimal set of relevant features compared with a few of the most advanced supervised classifiers such as maximum likelihood classifier (MLC), Navie Bayes, multi-layer perception (MLP), support vector machine (SVM) and bagging.},

Based on our comprehensive analysis of published data sources and expert input, the number of tree species currently known to science is 60,065, representing 20\% of all angiosperm and gymnosperm plant species. Nearly half of all tree species (45\%) are found in just 10 families, with the 3 most tree-rich families being Leguminosae, Rubiaceae, and Myrtaceae. Geographically, Brazil, Colombia, and Indonesia are the countries with the most tree species. The countries with the most country-endemic tree species reflect broader plant diversity trends (Brazil, Australia, China) or islands where isolation has resulted in speciation (Madagascar, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia). Nearly 58\% of all tree species are single-country endemics. Our intention is for GlobalTreeSearch to be used as a tool for monitoring and managing tree species diversity, forests, and carbon stocks on a global, regional, and/or national level. It will also be used as the basis of the Global Tree Assessment, which aims to assess the conservation status of all of the world’s tree species by 2020.},

	abstract = {The internal transcribed spacers (ITS) of nuclear ribosomal DNA are widely used for phylogenetic inference. Several characteristics, including the influence of RNA secondary structure on the mutational dynamics of ITS, may impact on the accuracy of phylogenies estimated from these regions. Here, we develop RNA secondary structure predictions for representatives of the angiosperm family Myrtaceae. On this basis, we assess the utility of structural (stem vs. loop) partitioning, and RNA-specific (paired-sites) models for a 76 taxon Syzygium alignment, and for a broader, family-wide Myrtaceae ITS data set. We use a permutation approach to demonstrate that structural partitioning significantly improves the likelihood of the data. Similarly, models that account for the non-independence of stem-pairs in RNA structure have a higher likelihood than those that do not. The best-fit RNA models for ITS are those that exclude simultaneous double substitutions in stem-pairs, which suggests an absence of strong selection against non-canonical (G·U/U·G) base-pairs at a high proportion of stem-paired sites. We apply the RNA-specific models to the phylogeny of Syzygium and Myrtaceae and contrast these with hypotheses derived using standard 4-state models. There is little practical difference amongst relationships inferred for Syzygium although for Myrtaceae, there are several differences. The RNA-specific approach finds topologies that are less resolved but are more consistent with conventional views of myrtaceous relationships, compared with the 4-state models.},

Four stomatal types (anisocytic, anomocytic, cyclo-staurocytic and paracytic) that occur exclusively or in combinations are recognised. Two major vascular systems are differentiated by the presence or absence of adaxial phloem partition. Phylogenetic inferences using maximum parsimony and Bayesian methods for separate and combined analyses of DNA (ETS and ITS) sequences and morphological (leaf anatomy and macromorphology) data were conducted. Results of the combined analyses gave slightly higher support value for clade than analyses based on DNA sequences. The subgenera Perikion, Sequestratum and Syzygium are strongly supported, but the subgenus Acmena is moderately supported in the Bayesian but not in the parsimony analysis of combined data sets. The relationships among subgenera are not fully resolved. All the leaf anatomical characters examined are homoplastic. We did not find any unique leaf anatomical characters allowing delimiting of the four subgenera in Syzygium. However, a combinations of non-unique leaf anatomical characters, including stomatal types, crystal types and frequency, and midrib vascular system (adaxial phloem partition) are diagnostic for subgeneric groups.},

Small-scale population studies of Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Eucalyptus cladocalyx, Eucalyptus globulus, Eucalyptus grandis, Eucalyptus nitens, Eucalyptus pilularis and Eucalyptus urophylla demonstrated the potential of genome-wide genotyping with DArT markers to differentiate species, to identify interspecific hybrids and to resolve biogeographic disjunctions within species. The population genetic studies resolved geographically partitioned clusters in E. camaldulensis, E. cladocalyx, E. globulus and E. urophylla that were congruent with previous molecular studies. A phylogenetic study of 94 eucalypt species provided results that were largely congruent with traditional taxonomy and ITS-based phylogenies, but provided more resolution within major clades than had been obtained previously. Ascertainment bias (the bias introduced in a phylogeny from using markers developed in a small sample of the taxa that are being studied) was not detected. DArT offers an unprecedented level of resolution for population genetic, phylogenetic and evolutionary studies across the full range of Eucalyptus species.},

Verticillium wilt (VW) of olive caused by Verticillium dahliae can be controlled only if detected at early stages of development. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM) classification methods were applied to classify V. dahliae severity using remote sensing at large scale. High-resolution thermal and hyperspectral imagery were acquired with a manned platform which flew a 3000-ha commercial olive area. LDA reached an overall accuracy of 59.0\% and a κ of 0.487 while SVM obtained a higher overall accuracy, 79.2\% with a similar κ, 0.495. However, LDA better classified trees at initial and low severity levels, reaching accuracies of 71.4 and 75.0\%, respectively, in comparison with the 14.3\% and 40.6\% obtained by SVM. Normalized canopy temperature, chlorophyll fluorescence, structural, xanthophyll, chlorophyll, carotenoid and disease indices were found to be the best indicators for early and advanced stage infection by VW. These results demonstrate that the methods developed in other studies at orchard scale are valid for flights in large areas comprising several olive orchards differing in soil and crop management characteristics.},

Foliar anthocyanin accumulates in young, expanding foliage, in autumnal foliage of deciduous species, in response to nutrient deficiency or ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure, and in association with damage or defense against browsing herbivores or pathogenic fungal infection. A common thread through these causative factors is low photosynthetic capacity of foliage with accumulated anthocyanin relative to leaves at different ontogenetic stages or unaffected by the environmental factor in question. The ecophysiological function of anthocyanin has been hypothesized as: 1) a compatible solute contributing to osmotic adjustment to drought and frost stress; 2) an antioxidant; 3) a UV protectant; and 4) protection from visible light. Review of the internal leaf distribution of anthocyanin, of experimental evidence using seedlings, and of studies that directly investigated light absorption by anthocyanin and its development relative to recognized processes of photoprotection support the hypothesis that anthocyanins provide protection from visible light.},

	abstract = {Techniques for mapping and monitoring wetland species are critical for their sustainable management. Papyrus (Cyperus papyrus L.) is one of the most important species-rich habitats that characterize the Greater St. Lucia Wetlands Park (GSWP) in South Africa. This paper investigates whether papyrus could be discriminated from its co-existing species using ASD field spectrometer data ranging from 300 nm to 2500 nm, yielding a total of 2151 bands. Canopy spectral measurements from papyrus and three other species were collected in situ in the Greater St. Lucia Wetlands Park, South Africa. A new hierarchical method based on three integrated analysis levels was proposed and implemented to spectrally discriminate papyrus from other species as well as to reduce and subsequently select optimal bands for the potential discrimination of papyrus. In the first level of the analysis using ANOVA, we found that there were statistically significant differences in spectral reflectance between papyrus and other species on 412 wavelengths located in different portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Using the selected 412 bands, we further investigated the use of classification and regression trees (CART) in the second level of analysis to identify the most sensitive bands for spectral discrimination. This analysis yielded eight bands which are considered to be practical for upscaling to airborne or space borne sensors for mapping papyrus vegetation. The final sensitivity analysis level involved the application of Jeffries-Matusita (JM) distance to assess the relative importance of the selected eight bands in discriminating papyrus from other species. The results indicate that the best discrimination of papyrus from its co-existing species is possible with six bands located in the red-edge and near-infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Overall, the study concluded that spectral reflectance of papyrus and its co-existing species is statistically different, a promising result for the use of airborne and satellite sensors for mapping papyrus. The three-step hierarchical approach employed in this study could systematically reduce the dimensionality of bands to manageable levels, a move towards operational implementation with band specific sensors.},

Consequently, a noninvasive and spatially explicit method is needed to assess the vigour of mosses spread throughout rocky Antarctic landscapes.

* Turf chlorophyll a and b, water content and leaf density were selected as quantitative stress indicators. Reflectance of three dominant Antarctic mosses Bryum pseudotriquetrum, Ceratodon purpureus and Schistidium antarctici was measured during a drought-stress and recovery laboratory experiment and also with an imaging spectrometer outdoors on water-deficient (stressed) and well-watered (unstressed) moss test sites. The stress-indicating moss traits were derived from visible and near infrared turf reflectance using a nonlinear support vector regression.


* Laboratory estimates of chlorophyll content and leaf density were achieved with the lowest systematic/unsystematic root mean square errors of 38.0/235.2 nmol g−1 DW and 0.8/1.6 leaves mm−1, respectively. Subsequent combination of these indicators retrieved from field hyperspectral images produced small-scale maps indicating relative moss vigour.


* Once applied and validated on remotely sensed airborne spectral images, this methodology could provide quantitative maps suitable for long-term monitoring of Antarctic moss-bed health.},

In this article the principles of the subject are explained and its historical development reviewed with reference to the instruments and methods adopted. Field spectroscopy has a role to play in at least three areas of remote sensing. Firstly, it acts as a ridge between laboratory measurements of spectral reflectance and the field situation and is thus useful in the calibration of airborne and satellite sensors. Secondly, it is useful in predicting the optimum spectral bands, viewing configuration and time to perform a particular remote sensing task. Thirdly, it provides a tool for the development, refinement and testing of models relating biophysical attributes to remotely-sensed data.},

Spectral vegetation indices (VIs), reflectance spectra, continuum removal spectra, and the amplitude of the red edge peak (drre) based on 61 well-replicated field measurements across a large area in Inner Mongolia were used to develop empirical models for estimating four key canopy biophysical features: percent green coverage (PGC), canopy height (H), green aboveground biomass (GBM), and total aboveground biomass (TBM). The results showed that NDVI, EVI, NDSVI, and LSWI were useful for estimating canopy biophysical features, with NDSVI being the most significant variable. The PGC was accurately estimated with spectral reflectance at 441 nm and 2220 nm (R2 = 0.71), while the maximum depth of band (Dc), absorption area (Darea) in the red domain and drre were selected for estimating TBM and GBM (R2 = 0.51 and 0.44). Among the four canopy features, PGC received the highest confidence from all of the models (R2 = 0.81), while H was the most difficult to estimate (R2 = 0.49). Finally, the degree of disturbances and ecosystem types appeared to be a significant variable for model development.},

	abstract = {Discriminating increaser species is important for mapping rangeland degradation. The main objectives of this paper were to (1) determine whether four increaser species could be discriminated from each other and (2) determine the key wavelengths that have high discriminatory power. Spectral data were taken at canopy level from Hyparrhenia hirta, Eragrostis curvula, Sporobolus africanus and Aristida diffuse from Okhombe rangeland, KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa. A field portable analytical spectral device with spectral range from 350 nm to 2500 nm was used in the analysis. Three-tier hierarchical techniques of One-way ANOVA, stepwise discriminant function analysis and canonical function analysis were used. The results revealed that there were statistically significant differences in spectral reflectance among four species on 439 wavelengths. The most important eight wavelengths (665 nm, 729 nm, 848 nm, 895 nm, 1039 nm, 998 nm, 681 nm and 972 nm) that have been selected for spectral discrimination were largely located in the visible, red-edge and near-infrared regions of the spectrum. The three tiers of analysis yielded species discrimination with an overall accuracy of 83 percent and a KHAT value of 0.77. The use of the spectroscopic approach applied in this study indicated that the increaser species were spectrally different. Therefore, these results encouraged further investigation into the possibility of mapping increaser species as indicators of different levels of rangeland degradation.},

Since 2006, different genotypes of A. psidii have spread to countries in the Pacific and to South Africa (Roux et al. 2016). The pathogen was recently discovered on Eucalyptus pellita and Melaleuca leucadendra in Indonesia (McTaggart et al. 2015). Three suspected specimens of A. psidii were collected in August 2016 from Singapore on leaves of Rhodomyrtus tomentosa (Myrtaceae), a tree native to southeastern Asia. The symptoms were the same as those caused by this pathogen with unmistakable yellow pustules of uredinia on the young leaves and inflorescences. The specimens were lodged in the PREM herbarium, South Africa (PREM 61592, 61593, 61594). Uredinia and telia were present on the abaxial leaf surface of PREM 61592. Urediniospores were ellipsoid to obovoid, 19–24 × 16–21 µm; wall 1.5‒2.0 µm thick, finely echinulate. Teliospores were cylindrical or ellipsoidal, 2-celled, apex rounded, pale yellowish brown, (29–) 35–45 (–50) × 16–23 µm; wall 1‒2 µm thick, smooth; pedicel up to 15 µm long. This was morphologically similar to the description of A. psidii in Australia (available at: http://collections.daff.qld.gov.au/web/key/rustfungi/Media/Html/pucciniapsidii.html) (Shivas et al. 2014). A DNA sequence-based identification was made using the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and large subunit (LSU) regions of ribosomal DNA. The ITS sequences were 99\% identical (551 out of 555 base pairs) to KM282154, the epitype sequence of A. psidii (Machado et al. 2015). The ITS and LSU sequences had 99–100\% identity to specimens from Indonesia, with one degenerate base pair difference in the ITS region (McTaggart et al. 2015). The sequences obtained were deposited in GenBank as KY816929 and KY816930. The genotype of the isolates from Singapore was not determined, but may be the same as in Indonesia (McTaggart et al. 2015), which has the pandemic strain, so named due to its spread through the Pacific. This report of A. psidii in Singapore may indicate the rust will spread further through Southeast Asia, into countries such as Malaysia and Thailand.},

	abstract = {Biological invasions in forests are growing in number and importance globally. The best studied examples are those caused by plants and animals, including insects. In contrast, forest invasions caused by microbes, including fungi, have received much lower levels of attention, particularly in the invasion biology literature. This can at least to some extent be due to the large number of these organisms involved and the fact that the majority of these have yet to be discovered and described. This is equally true for tree-infecting fungi, many of which are devastating pathogens responsible for dramatic invasions in natural and planted forests. This situation is changing through the application of molecular genetic tools that make it possible to accurately identify fungal tree pathogens, to determine their origins, pathways of movement, their modes of reproduction and change; all of which can influence invasions. The role and relevance of symbioses between tree pathogens and insects in forest invasions is also gaining increased attention. So too is our understanding that trees live in close association with large numbers of microbes that make up their holobiome. This has substantial relevance to invasion biology (Zenni et al. 2017). This commentary highlights four emerging issues that need to be considered regarding the invasions by fungal pathogens of trees and it emphasizes opportunities to better understand their relevance and impacts on natural and planted forests. A call is also made for plant pathologists to work more closely with ecologists such that fungal pathogens become more commonly integrated into invasion biology programmes.},

These indices have been widely implemented within RS applications using different airborne and satellite platforms with recent advances using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). Up to date, there is no unified mathematical expression that defines all VIs due to the complexity of different light spectra combinations, instrumentation, platforms, and resolutions used. Therefore, customized algorithms have been developed and tested against a variety of applications according to specific mathematical expressions that combine visible light radiation, mainly green spectra region, from vegetation, and nonvisible spectra to obtain proxy quantifications of the vegetation surface. In the real-world applications, optimization VIs are usually tailored to the specific application requirements coupled with appropriate validation tools and methodologies in the ground. The present study introduces the spectral characteristics of vegetation and summarizes the development of VIs and the advantages and disadvantages from different indices developed. This paper reviews more than 100 VIs, discussing their specific applicability and representativeness according to the vegetation of interest, environment, and implementation precision. Predictably, research, and development of VIs, which are based on hyperspectral and UAV platforms, would have a wide applicability in different areas.},

	abstract = {The invasive shrub, Acacia longifolia, native to southeastern Australia, has a negative impact on vegetation and ecosystem functioning in Portuguese dune ecosystems. In order to spectrally discriminate A. longifolia from other non-native and native species, we developed a classification model based on leaf reflectance spectra (350–2500 nm) and condensed leaf tannin content. High variation of leaf tannin content is common for Mediterranean shrub and tree species, in particular between N-fixing and non-N-fixing species, as well as within the genus, Acacia. However, variation in leaf tannin content has not been studied in coastal dune ecosystems in southwest Portugal. We hypothesized that condensed tannin concentration varies significantly across species, further allowing for distinguishing invasive, nitrogen-fixing A. longifolia from other vegetation based on leaf spectral reflectance data. Spectral field measurements were carried out using an ASD FieldSpec FR spectroradiometer attached to an ASD leaf clip in order to collect 750 in situ leaf reflectance spectra of seven frequent plant species at three study sites in southwest Portugal. We applied partial least squares (PLS) regression to predict the obtained leaf reflectance spectra of A. longifolia individuals to their corresponding tannin concentration. A. longifolia had the lowest tannin concentration of all investigated species. Four wavelength regions (675–710 nm, 1060–1170 nm, 1360–1450 nm and 1630–1740 nm) were identified as being highly correlated with tannin concentration. A spectra-based classification model of the different plant species was calculated using a principal component analysis-linear discriminant analysis (PCA-LDA). The best prediction of A. longifolia was achieved by using wavelength regions between 1360–1450 nm and 1630–1740 nm, resulting in a user’s accuracy of 98.9\%. In comparison, selecting the entire wavelength range, the best user accuracy only reached 86.5\% for A. longifolia individuals.},

	abstract = {Verticillium wilt (VW) caused by the soil-borne fungus Verticillium dahliae Kleb, is the most limiting disease in all traditional olive-growing regions worldwide. This pathogen colonizes the vascular system of plants, blocking water flow and eventually inducing water stress. The present study explored the use of high-resolution thermal imagery, chlorophyll fluorescence, structural and physiological indices (xanthophyll, chlorophyll a + b, carotenoids and blue/green/red B/G/R indices) calculated from multispectral and hyperspectral imagery as early indicators of water stress caused by VW infection and severity. The study was conducted in two olive orchards naturally infected with V. dahliae. Time series of airborne thermal, multispectral and hyperspectral imagery was acquired in three consecutive years and related to VW severity at the time of the flights. Concurrently to the airborne campaigns, field measurements conducted at leaf and tree-crown levels showed a significant increase in crown temperature (Tc) minus air temperature (Ta) and a decrease in leaf stomatal conductance (G) across VW severity levels, identifying VW-infected trees at early stages of the disease. Higher Tc − Ta and G values measured in the field were associated with higher VW severity levels. At leaf level, the reduction in G caused by VW infection was associated with a significant increase in the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI570) and a decrease in chlorophyll fluorescence (F). The airborne flights enabled the early detection of VW by using canopy-level image-derived airborne Tc − Ta, Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) calculated from the thermal imagery, blue/blue–green/blue–red ratios (B/BG/BR indices) and chlorophyll fluorescence, confirming the results obtained in the field. Airborne Tc − Ta showed rising values with a significant increase of {\textasciitilde} 2 K at low VW severity levels, and was significantly correlated with G (R2 = 0.76, P = 0.002) and PRI570 (R2 = 0.51, P = 0.032). Early stages of disease development could be differentiated based on a CWSI increase as VW developed, obtaining a strong correlation with G (R2 = 0.83, P \&lt; 0.001). Likewise, the canopy-level chlorophyll fluorescence dropped at high VW severity levels, showing a significant increase as disease progressed. These results indicate the potentials of an early detection of V. dahliae infection and discrimination of VW severity levels using remote sensing. Indicators based on crown temperature such as CWSI, and visible ratios B/BG/BR as well as fluorescence were effective in detecting VW at early stages of disease development. In affected trees, the structural indices PRI, chlorophyll and carotenoid indices, and the R/G ratio were good indicators to assess the damage caused by the disease.},

	abstract = {Purpose of ReviewIn this review, we highlight recent developments and applications in remote sensing that can improve the accuracy and timeliness of health assessments in plantations managed for timber and pulp production. The detection and mapping of damage extent and severity caused by insect pests and fungal pathogens is a common requirement of foresters managing plantations. The objectives of these surveys can range from early detection for targeted intervention to more strategic aims of predicting stand susceptibility or evaluating the performance of management strategies.Recent FindingsRecent developments in remote sensing technologies and big data modelling techniques can now provide spatially explicit, quantitative solutions for these management objectives that are more accurate than manual field-based assessments of tree damage or airborne visual mapping. Past studies have identified a large number of spectral, textural and structural metrics that have been used in models to classify specific tree crown damage symptoms. This process requires a detailed understanding of the chronology of crown symptoms for specific damaging agents and the spectral responses to these symptoms. Continuing increases in the spatial and spectral resolution of remote sensors enables crown-level damage classification.SummaryThe development of data processing workflows that fuse spectral information with three-dimensional (3D) data acquired simultaneously from single or different remote platforms promote the opportunities to derive both structural and physiological crown-level attributes that relate to crown damage. The simultaneous acquisition of spectral and 3D point data will enable plantation foresters to derive several spatial products, including the assessment of tree health in a cost-effective manner.},

	abstract = {Large-scale farming of agricultural crops requires on-time detection of diseases for pest management. Hyperspectral remote sensing data taken from low-altitude flights usually have high spectral and spatial resolutions, which can be very useful in detecting stress in green vegetation. In this study, we used late blight in tomatoes to illustrate the capability of applying hyperspectral remote sensing to monitor crop disease in the field scale and to develop the methodologies for the purpose. A series of field experiments was conducted to collect the canopy spectral reflectance of tomato plants in a diseased tomato field in Salinas Valley of California. The disease severity varied from stage 1 (the light symptom), to stage 4 (the sever damage). The economic damage of the crop caused by the disease is around the disease stage 3. An airborne visible infrared imaging spectrometer (AVIRIS) image with 224 bands within the wavelength range of 0.4–2.5 μm was acquired during the growing season when the field data were collected. The spectral reflectance of the field samples indicated that the near infrared (NIR) region, especially 0.7–1.3 μm, was much more valuable than the visible range to detect crop disease. The difference of spectral reflectance in visible range between health plants and the infected ones at stage 3 was only 1.19\%, while the difference in the NIR region was high, 10\%. We developed an approach including the minimum noise fraction (MNF) transformation, multi-dimensional visualization, pure pixels endmember selection and spectral angle mapping (SAM) to process the hyperspectral image for identification of diseased tomato plants. The results of MNF transformation indicated that the first 28 eigenimages contain useful information for classification of the pixels and the rest were mainly noise-dominated due to their low eigenvalues that had few signals. Therefore, the 28 signal eigenimages were used to generate a multi-dimensional visualization space for endmember spectra selection and SAM. Classification with the SAM technique of plants’ spectra showed that the late blight diseased tomatoes at stage 3 or above could be separated from the healthy plants while the less infected plants (at stage 1 or 2) were difficult to separate from the healthy plants. The results of the image analysis were consistent with the field spectra. The mapped disease distribution at stage 3 or above from the image showed an accurate conformation of late blight occurrence in the field. This result not only confirmed the capability of hyperspectral remote sensing in detecting crop disease for precision disease management in the real world, but also demonstrated that the spectra-based classification approach is an applicable method to crop disease identification.},

	abstract = {Precision agriculture (PA) utilizes tools and technologies to identify in-field soil and crop variability for improving farming practices and optimizing agronomic inputs. Traditionally, optical remote sensing (RS) that utilizes visible light and infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum has been used as an integral part of PA for crop and soil monitoring. Optical RS, however, is slow in differentiating stress levels in crops until visual symptoms become noticeable. Surface temperature is considered to be a rapid response variable that can indicate crop stresses prior to their visual symptoms. By measuring estimates of surface temperature, thermal RS has been found to be a promising tool for PA. Compared to optical RS, applications of thermal RS for PA have been limited. Until recently (i.e., before the advancement of low cost RS platforms such as unmanned aerial systems (UAVs)), the availability of high resolution thermal images was limited due to high acquisition costs. Given recent developments in UAVs, thermal images with high spatial and temporal resolutions have become available at a low cost, which has increased opportunities to understand in-field variability of crop and soil conditions useful for various agronomic decision-making. Before thermal RS is adopted as a routine tool for crop and environmental monitoring, there is a need to understand its current and potential applications as well as issues and concerns. This review focuses on current and potential applications of thermal RS in PA as well as some concerns relating to its application. The application areas of thermal RS in agriculture discussed here include irrigation scheduling, drought monitoring, crop disease detection, and mapping of soil properties, residues and tillage, field tiles, and crop maturity and yield. Some of the issues related to its application include spatial and temporal resolution, atmospheric conditions, and crop growth stages.},

	abstract = {Satellite remote sensing of plant phenology provides an important indicator of climate change. However, start of the growing season (SOS) estimates in Northern Hemisphere boreal forest areas are known to be challenged by the presence of seasonal snow cover and limited seasonality in the greenness signal for evergreen needleleaf forests, which can both bias and impede trend estimates of SOS. The newly developed Plant Phenology Index (PPI) was specifically designed to overcome both problems. Here we use Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data (2000–2014) to analyze the ability of PPI for estimating start of season (SOS) in boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, in comparison to two other widely applied indices for SOS retrieval: the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). Satellite-based SOS is evaluated against gross primary production (GPP)-retrieved SOS derived from a network of flux tower observations in boreal areas (a total of 81 site-years analyzed). Spatiotemporal relationships between SOS derived from PPI, EVI and NDVI are furthermore studied for different boreal land cover types and regions. The overall correlation between SOS derived from VIs and ground measurements was rather low, but PPI performed significantly better (r = 0.50, p \&lt; 0.01) than EVI and NDVI which both showed a very poor correlation (r = 0.11, p = 0. 16 and r = 0.08, p = 0.24). PPI, EVI and NDVI overall produce similar trends in SOS for the Northern Hemisphere showing an advance in SOS towards earlier dates (0.28, 0.23 and 0.26 days/year), but a pronounced difference in trend estimates between PPI and EVI/NDVI is observed for different land cover types. Deciduous needleleaf forest is characterized by the largest advance in SOS when considering all indices, yet PPI showed less dramatic changes as compared to EVI/NDVI (0.47 days/year as compared to 0.62 and 0.74). PPI SOS trends were found to be higher for deciduous broadleaf forests and savannas (0.54 and 0.56 days/year). Taken together, the findings of this study suggest improved performance of PPI over NDVI and EVI in retrieval of SOS in boreal regions and precautions must be taken when interpreting spatio-temporal patterns of SOS from the latter two indices.},

The most successful treatment (94\%) was tissue culture, often in combination with thermotherapy to eradicate viral or bacterial pathogens from plants held in in germplasm collections. Whilst 6\% of these programs had no reported outcome, there were no recorded failures of this strategy. Host removal and/or destruction was successful in 55\% of the programs and was used against all the pathogen groups. The analysis was limited by the high percentage of unknown outcome results across the pathogen groups. A quarter (49 of 190) of the records contained no indication of the eradication treatment: in 43\% of these cases an unknown treatment resulted in successful eradication. There were no obvious correlations between the characteristics of a pathogen (viral/viroid, bacterial/phytoplasma, fungal/oomycete or nematode) and the outcome of the eradication program. For many species there is only one record, or the taxa records were dominated by a few genera that do not represent the biological diversity of the pathogen group. No economic or other analysis was possible due to the large number of unknown result/ongoing programs and the lack of common data. Despite these limitations, GERDA is an important record of the outcomes of worldwide plant pathogen eradication programs since the second decade of the twentieth century. However, care should be exercised when extrapolating from these records to formulating responses to new taxa as pathogens emerge and/or adapt to new plant hosts as the biology of plant pathogens is extremely variable and this diversity is not represented by the records in the database.},

Past remote sensing based mapping approaches of urban green have mainly focused on broad vegetation classes (tree - scrub - grass) or species identification, failing to deliver the detailed functional information required by urban ecologists, planners and managers. The end goal of our research is to develop a detailed functional urban green typology in combination with a multi-stage classification algorithm based on airborne hyperspectral data and LiDAR. In this paper, we conduct a spectral separability analysis and subsequent sub-pixel classification of common urban green types in Brussels, Belgium, to explore the potential of hyperspectral data for our purposes. Except for extensive green roofs and, to a lesser extent, coniferous trees, the distinction between different urban green types based solely on the amplitude and shape of the spectral signal proved to be difficult. In future research, we will therefore explore additional classification strategies, including spectral feature selection, integration with height information from LiDAR and object-based classification.},

Although widespread impacts on intertidal ecosystems are anticipated to arise from the sea level seesaw associated with climate change, none have yet been demonstrated. Intertidal ecosystems, including mangrove forests are among those ecosystems that are highly vulnerable to sea level rise, but they may also be vulnerable to sea level variability and extreme low sea level events. During 16 years of monitoring of a mangrove forest in Mangrove Bay in north Western Australia, we documented two forest dieback events, the most recent one being coincident with the large-scale dieback of mangroves in the Gulf of Carpentaria in northern Australia. Diebacks in Mangrove Bay were coincident with periods of very low sea level, which were associated with increased soil salinization of 20-30\% above pre-event levels, leading to canopy loss, reduced Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and reduced recruitment. Our study indicates that an intensification of ENSO will have negative effects on some mangrove forests in parts of the Indo-Pacific that will exacerbate other pressures.},

Two MODIS vegetation indices (VI), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), are produced at 1-km and 500-m resolutions and 16-day compositing periods. This paper presents an initial analysis of the MODIS NDVI and EVI performance from both radiometric and biophysical perspectives. We utilize a combination of site-intensive and regionally extensive approaches to demonstrate the performance and validity of the two indices. Our results showed a good correspondence between airborne-measured, top-of-canopy reflectances and VI values with those from the MODIS sensor at four intensively measured test sites representing semi-arid grass/shrub, savanna, and tropical forest biomes. Simultaneously derived field biophysical measures also demonstrated the scientific utility of the MODIS VI. Multitemporal profiles of the MODIS VIs over numerous biome types in North and South America well represented their seasonal phenologies. Comparisons of the MODIS-NDVI with the NOAA-14, 1-km AVHRR-NDVI temporal profiles showed that the MODIS-based index performed with higher fidelity. The dynamic range of the MODIS VIs are presented and their sensitivities in discriminating vegetation differences are evaluated in sparse and dense vegetation areas. We found the NDVI to asymptotically saturate in high biomass regions such as in the Amazon while the EVI remained sensitive to canopy variations.},

	abstract = {The photochemical reflectance index (PRI), derived from narrow-band reflectance at 531 and 570 nm, was explored as an indicator of photosynthetic radiation use efficiency for 20 species representing three functional types: annual, deciduous perennial, and evergreen perennial. Across species, top-canopy leaves in full sun at midday exhibited a strong correlation between PRI and ΔF/Fm′, a fluorescence-based index of photosystem II (PSII) photochemical efficiency. PRI was also significantly correlated with both net CO2 uptake and radiation use efficiency measured by gas exchange. When species were examined by functional type, evergreens exhibited significantly reduced midday photosynthetic rates relative to annual and deciduous species. This midday reduction was associated with reduced radiation use efficiency, detectable as reduced net CO2 uptake, PRI, and ΔF/Fm′ values, and increased levels of the photoprotective xanthophyll cycle pigment zeaxanthin. For each functional type, nutrient deficiency led to reductions in both PRI and ΔF/Fm′ relative to fertilized controls. Laboratory experiments exposing leaves to diurnal courses of radiation and simulated midday stomatal closure demonstrated that PRI changed rapidly with both irradiance and leaf physiological state. In these studies, PRI was closely correlated with both ΔF/Fm' and radiation use efficiency determined from gas exchange at all but the lowest light levels. Examination of the difference spectra upon exposure to increasing light levels revealed that the 531 nm Δ reflectance signal was composed of two spectral components. At low irradiance, this signal was dominated by a 545-nm component, which was not closely related to radiation use efficiency. At progressively higher light levels above 100 μmol m−2 s−1, the 531-nm signal was increasingly dominated by a 526-nm component, which was correlated with light use efficiency and with the conversion of the xanthophyll pigment violaxanthin to antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin. Further consideration of the two components composing the 531-nm signal could lead to an index of photosynthetic function applicable over a wide range of illumination. The results of this study support the use of PRI as an interspecific index of photosynthetic radiation use efficiency for leaves and canopies in full sun, but not across wide ranges in illumination from deep shade to full sun. The discovery of a consistent relationship between PRI and photosynthetic radiation use efficiency for top-canopy leaves across species, functional types, and nutrient treatments suggests that relative photosynthetic rates could be derived with the “view from above” provided by remote reflectance measurements if issues of canopy and stand structure can be resolved.},

High-resolution thermal and hyperspectral airborne imagery was acquired from two flights and compared with concurrent field visual evaluations for disease incidence and severity. Canopy temperature and vegetation indices were calculated from thermal and hyperspectral imagery and analyzed for their ability to detect the disease at early stages. The classification methods linear discriminant analysis and support vector machine, using linear and radial basis kernels, were applied to a combination of these vegetation indices in order to quantify and discriminate between red leaf blotch severity levels. Chlorophyll and carotenoid indices and chlorophyll fluorescence were effective in detecting red leaf blotch at the early stages of disease development. Linear models showed higher power to separate between asymptomatic trees and those affected by advanced stages of disease development while the non-linear model was better in discriminating asymptomatic plants from those at early stages of red leaf blotch development. Leaf-level measurements of stomatal conductance, chlorophyll content, chlorophyll fluorescence, photochemical reflectance index, and spectral reflectance showed no significant differences between healthy leaves and the green areas of symptomatic leaves.

Due to recent changes in the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, this is an urgent matter that requires community attention. The alternative is to break the longstanding concept of Fusarium into nine or more genera, and remove important taxa such as those in the F. solani species complex from the genus, a move we believe is unnecessary.

The relationship between chlorophyll fluorescence and the mechanisms of photosynthesis have been the subject of a great number of investigations, since Kautsky discovered (Kautsky and Hirsch 1931) that fluorescence intensity in green leaves displays characteristic changes upon illumination (Kautsky effect - for reviews, see Papageorgiou 1975; Lavorel and Etienne 1977; Krause and Weis 1984). For almost half a century fluorescence has been mainly a tool for biophysically oriented researchers in studies of the primary processes of photosynthesis. Practical applications of the Kautsky effect in ecophysiological work had been limited by the availability of suitable instrumentation and by the complexity of the fluorescence information obtained in vivo. In recent years considerable efforts have been put into the development of field oriented fluorescence equipment and into the development of the methodology for analysing fluorescence data from intact leaves.},

	abstract = {The remote detection of water stress in a citrus orchard was investigated using leaf-level measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence and Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) data, seasonal time-series of crown temperature and PRI, and high-resolution airborne imagery. The work was conducted in an orchard where a regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) experiment generated a gradient in water stress levels. Stomatal conductance (Gs) and water potential (Ψ) were measured over the season on each treatment block. The airborne data consisted on thermal and hyperspectral imagery acquired at the time of maximum stress differences among treatments, prior to the re-watering phase, using a miniaturized thermal camera and a micro-hyperspectral imager on board an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The hyperspectral imagery was acquired at 40 cm resolution and 260 spectral bands in the 400-885 nm spectral range at 6.4 nm full width at half maximum (FWHM) spectral resolution and 1.85 nm sampling interval, enabling the identification of pure crowns for extracting radiance and reflectance hyperspectral spectra from each tree. The FluorMOD model was used to investigate the retrieval of chlorophyll fluorescence by applying the Fraunhofer Line Depth (FLD) principle using three spectral bands (FLD3), which demonstrated that fluorescence retrieval was feasible with the configuration of the UAV micro-hyperspectral instrument flown over the orchard. Results demonstrated the link between seasonal PRI and crown temperature acquired from instrumented trees and field measurements of stomatal conductance and water potential. The sensitivity of PRI and Tc–Ta time-series to water stress levels demonstrated a time delay of PRI vs Tc–Ta during the recovery phase after re-watering started. At the time of the maximum stress difference among treatment blocks, the airborne imagery acquired from the UAV platform demonstrated that the crown temperature yielded the best coefficient of determination for Gs (r2 = 0.78; p \&lt; 0.05) and Ψ (r2 = 0.34; p \&lt; 0.001). Among the narrow-band indices calculated, the PRI515 index (reference band = 515 nm) obtained better results than PRI570, with r2 = 0.59 (p \&lt; 0.01) for Gs, and r2 = 0.38 (p \&lt; 0.001) for Ψ. The BGI1 index calculated from the blue (R400) and green (R550) bands resulted on the highest significance levels (p \&lt; 0.001) for both Gs (r2 = 0.62) and Ψ (r2 = 0.49). Out of the structural indices assessed, RDVI, MTVI1 and TVI showed greater sensitivity for Gs (r2 = 0.6; p \&lt; 0.01) and Ψ (p \&lt; 0.001) than NDVI. Chlorophyll fluorescence calculated from the micro-hyperspectral imagery with the FLD3 method tracked stress levels, obtaining r2 = 0.67 (p \&lt; 0.05) with stomatal conductance, and r2 = 0.66 (p \&lt; 0.001) with water potential. The work presented in this manuscript demonstrates the feasibility of thermal, narrow-band indices and fluorescence retrievals obtained from a micro-hyperspectral imager and a light-weight thermal camera on board small UAV platforms for stress detection in a heterogeneous tree canopy where very high resolution is required.},

	abstract = {The integration of rooftop greenhouses (RTGs) in urban buildings is a practice that is becoming increasingly important in the world for their contribution to food security and sustainable development. However, the supply of tools and procedures to facilitate their implementation at the city scale is limited and laborious. This work aims to develop a specific and automated methodology for identifying the feasibility of implementation of rooftop greenhouses in non-residential urban areas, using airborne sensors. The use of Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) and Long Wave Infrared (LWIR) data and the Leica ALS50-II and TASI-600 sensors allow for the identification of some building roof parameters (area, slope, materials, and solar radiation) to determine the potential for constructing a RTG. This development represents an improvement in time and accuracy with respect to previous methodology, where all the relevant information must be acquired manually.
The methodology has been applied and validated in a case study corresponding to a non-residential urban area in the industrial municipality of Rubí, Barcelona (Spain). Based on this practical application, an area of 36,312 m2 out of a total area of 1,243,540 m2 of roofs with ideal characteristics for the construction of RTGs was identified. This area can produce approximately 600 tons of tomatoes per year, which represents the average yearly consumption for about 50\% of Rubí total population.
The use of this methodology also facilitates the decision making process in urban agriculture, allowing a quick identification of optimal surfaces for the future implementation of urban agriculture in housing. It also opens new avenues for the use of airborne technology in environmental topics in cities.},

Hyperspectral absorption features are important indicators of characterizing plant biophysical variables for the automatic diagnosis of crop diseases. Continuous wavelet analysis has proven to be an advanced hyperspectral analysis technique for extracting absorption features; however, specific wavelet features (WFs) and their relationship with pathological characteristics induced by different infestations have rarely been summarized. The aim of this research is to determine the most sensitive WFs for identifying specific pathological lesions from yellow rust and powdery mildew in winter wheat, based on 314 hyperspectral samples measured in field experiments in China in 2002, 2003, 2005, and 2012. The resultant WFs could be used as proxies to capture the major spectral absorption features caused by infestation of yellow rust or powdery mildew. Multivariate regression analysis based on these WFs outperformed conventional spectral features in disease detection; meanwhile, a Fisher discrimination model exhibited considerable potential for generating separable clusters for each infestation. Optimal classification returned an overall accuracy of 91.9\% with a Kappa of 0.89. This paper also emphasizes the WFs and their relationship with pathological characteristics in order to provide a foundation for the further application of this approach in monitoring winter wheat diseases at the regional scale.},

	abstract = {Weed mapping at very early phenological stages of crop and weed plants for site-specific weed management can be achieved by using ultra-high spatial and high spectral resolution imagery provided by multispectral sensors on-board an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). These UAV images cannot cover the whole field, resulting in the need to take a sequence of multiple overlapped images. Therefore, the overlapped images must be oriented and ortho-rectified to create an accurate ortho-mosaicked image of the entire field for further classification. Because the spatial quality of ortho-mosaicked images mainly depend on the flight altitude and percentage of overlap, this paper describes the effect of flight parameters using a multirotor UAV and a multispectral camera on the mosaicking workflow. The objective is to define the best configuration for the mission planning to generate accurate ortho-images. A set of flights with a range of altitudes (30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90 m) above ground level (AGL) and two end-lap and side-lap settings (60–30\% and 70–40\%) were studied. The spatial accuracy of ortho-mosaics was evaluated taking into consideration the ASPRS test. The results showed that the best flight setting to keep the spatial accuracy in the bundle adjustment was 70–40\% overlap and altitudes AGL ranging from 60 to 90 m. At these flight altitudes, the spatial resolution was quite similar, making it possible to optimize the mission planning, flying at a higher altitude and increasing the area overflow without decreasing the ortho-mosaic spatial quality. This study has relevant implications for further use in detecting weed seedlings in crops.},

	abstract = {Thalassia testudinum (turtle grass) is the dominant and climax-successional seagrass species in the subtropical/tropical Atlantic and Caribbean region. Two die-offs of T. testudinum in Florida Bay, USA have raised concerns regarding the resilience of this species to environmental disturbances. Seedlings are important in recovery of T. testudinum, following disturbance events. Leaf spectral reflectance [R(λ)] was measured in T. testudinum seedlings exposed for two weeks to three salinities (20, 35, and 50) and two light levels (full sun and 50-70\% light reduction) in experimental mesocosms. Multivariate analyses indicated that hypersalinity had a greater effect on spectral reflectance than hyposalinity or light reduction. There was an increase in variability and flattening of reflectance spectra at the highest salinity. All three salinity treatments had distinct reflectance spectra across green wavelengths (530 – 580 nm), with additional discrimination between 20 versus 50 and 35 versus 50 treatments across red wavelengths (630 – 690 nm). Red:Green reflectance ratios were highest and photochemical reflective index (PRI) values were lowest for the salinity 50 treatment, but were not significantly different between the salinity 20 and 35 treatments. The changes in the R(λ) spectra for the salinity 50 seedlings were consistent with previously observed reductions in leaf pigments and maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II. These observations indicate that leaf spectral reflectance is a sensitive indicator of plant stress in T. testudinum seedlings and that seedlings are more sensitive to short-term exposures to hypersalinity than hyposalinity.},

Optical sensors are advanced techniques for phenotyping host-pathogen interactions on different scales and for detecting subtle plant resistance responses against pathogens. A microscope with a hyperspectral camera was used to study interactions between Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei and barley (Hordeum vulgare) genotypes with high susceptibility or resistance due to hypersensitive response (HR) and papilla formation. Qualitative and quantitative assessment of pathogen development was used to explain changes in hyperspectral signatures. Within 48 hours after inoculation, genotype specific changes in the green and red range (500-690 nm) and a blue shift of the red edge inflection point were observed. Manual analysis indicated resistance-specific reflectance patterns from one to three days after inoculation. These changes could be linked to host plant modifications depending on individual host-pathogen interactions, respectively. Retrospective analysis of hyperspectral images revealed spectral characteristics of HR against B. graminis f. sp. hordei. For early HR detection, an advanced data mining approach localized HR spots before they became visible on the RGB images derived from hyperspectral imaging. The link among processes during pathogenesis and host resistance to changes in hyperspectral signatures, provide evidence that sensor based phenotyping is suitable to advance time-consuming and cost-expensive visual rating of plant disease resistances.},

Kies were studied for the first time, using GC/MS and GC/FID techniques. A total of 178 components were identified, representing between 85.3\% and 100.0\% of the total oils. Some differences were observed in the composition of the essential oils of the two species but pronounced differences were also observed between different provenances of P. baccharidifolia from geographically separated populations. Five compounds, δ-cadinene, caryophyllene oxide, T-cadinol, T-muurolol and δ-cadinol (= α-muurolol, torreyol) were present in almost all Pegolettia samples. Of interest was the discovery of thymyl and isothymyl derivatives in two populations of P. baccharidifolia from the Vanwyksdorp area which were mainly in a dormant growth stage. However, 8,9-dehydrothymol was also present in two samples of P. baccharidifolia (0.1 and 0.2\% of total yield) that were taken from actively growing plants, and 8,9-dehydrothymol isobutyrate was present in P. retrofracta at 2.1\%. All other thymyl and isothymyl derivatives (thymol isobutyrate, 8,9-dehydrothymyl isobutyrate, 8,9-dehydrothymol, isothymyl valerate, thymyl valerate, isothymol, 8,9-dehydroisothymol isobutyrate, 10-isobutyryloxy-8,9-dehydrothymol isobutyrate, and 10-acetoxy-8,9-epoxythymol isobutyrate) were found only in the two Vanwyksdorp populations. The two species differ markedly in the shape and margins of the leaves, as well as in their surface appearance (glossy and bright green in P. baccharidifolia, dull green in P. retrofracta). However, the leaf trichomes (multicellular glands, probably the site of essential oil production and/or accumulation) are very similar in both species.},

	abstract = {Leaf epicuticular waxes are the interface between leaves and the atmosphere, acting in the reduction of water loss. Therefore, we believe this part of the cuticle influences species ecophysiological responses under different rainfall conditions. In this study, we investigated how the leaf epicuticular wax (EW) of Aspidosperma pyrifolium contributes to desiccation reduction, and its impacts on gas exchanges. We selected a site of preserved tropical seasonally dry forest, and analysed both intact leaves (control) and leaves that had the EW removed mechanically (without wax - WW). All measurements were made in May, for two consecutive years, with low (2013) and high (2014) precipitation. The results show that the EW strongly contributes to the maintenance of high photosynthetic rates on leaves, which are able to keep their stomata open for longer periods, with high water use efficiency. WW treatment leaves always presented lower A, gs and WUE rates, even in the wet year, however, most of the physiological losses were observed in the dry year. The WW plants degraded chlorophyll and invested in phenols as a strategy to prevent photo damage caused by the stomatal conductance reduction. Chemically, the major constituents of the EW of A. pyrifolium were triterpene alcohols. Despite the higher EW content in the dry year, the chemical composition was not associated with protection against water loss, since triterpenoids suggest a defence mechanism against herbivory. We concluded that: (i) the EW is important to the maintenance of gas exchanges and leaf metabolism in A. pyrifolium, and (ii) the effects of its removal are more intense in dry years.},

In order to test for and quantify differences between these sensors, a large set of coincident imagery was assembled for the Australian landscape. Comparisons were carried out in terms of surface reflectance, and also in terms of biophysical quantities estimated from the reflectances. Small but consistent differences were found, and suitable adjustment equations fitted to enable transformation of Sentinel-2A reflectance values to more closely match Landsat-7 or Landsat-8 values. This is useful if trying to take models and thresholds fitted from Landsat and use them with Sentinel-2. The fitted adjustment equations were also compared against those fitted globally for NASA’s Harmonized Landsat-8 Sentinel-2 product, and found to be substantially different, raising the possibility that such adjustments need to be fitted on a regional basis.},

We examined the suitability of 8-band WorldView-2 satellite data for the identification of 10 tree species in a temperate forest in Austria. We performed a Random Forest (RF) classification (object-based and pixel-based) using spectra of manually delineated sunlit regions of tree crowns. The overall accuracy for classifying 10 tree species was around 82\% (8 bands, object-based). The class-specific producer’s accuracies ranged between 33\% (European hornbeam) and 94\% (European beech) and the user’s accuracies between 57\% (European hornbeam) and 92\% (Lawson’s cypress). The object-based approach outperformed the pixel-based approach. We could show that the 4 new WorldView-2 bands (Coastal, Yellow, Red Edge, and Near Infrared 2) have only limited impact on classification accuracy if only the 4 main tree species (Norway spruce, Scots pine, European beech, and English oak) are to be separated. However, classification accuracy increased significantly using the full spectral resolution if further tree species were included. Beside the impact on overall classification accuracy, the importance of the spectral bands was evaluated with two measures provided by RF. An in-depth analysis of the RF output was carried out to evaluate the impact of reference data quality and the resulting reliability of final class assignments. Finally, an extensive literature review on tree species classification comprising about 20 studies is presented.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of how solar radiation interacts with vegetation is necessary to interpret and process remote sensing data of agricultural and many natural resources. A plant leaf typically has a low reflectance in the visible spectral region because of strong absorption by chlorophylls, a relatively high reflectance in the near-infrared because of internal leaf scattering and no absorption, and a relatively low reflectance in the infrared beyond 1.3 μ because of strong absorption by water. The reflectance of a plant canopy is similar, but is modified by the nonuniformity of incident solar radiation, plant structures, leaf areas, shadows, and background reflectivities. Airborne sensors receive an integrated view of all these effects, and each crop or vegetation type tends to have a characteristic signature which permits its discrimination. When disease and physiological stresses directly affect the reflectance properties of individual leaves, the most pronounced initial changes often occur in the visible spectral region rather than in the infrared because of the sensitivity of chlorophyll to physiological disturbances. The primary basis for the detection of stress conditions in a crop or other plant community by aerial remote sensors often, however, is not a change in the reflectance characteristics of individual leaves, but a reduction in the total leaf area exposed to the sensors. This reduction can result from a direct loss of leaves, a change in their orientation, or an overall suppression of plant growth. In such cases the total infrared reflectance tends to be decreased relatively more than the visible reflectance because of a reduction in the infrared enhancement due to fewer multiple leaf layers and because of an increase in background exposure.},

High spectral reflectance signatures of 11 eucalyptus species were measured in the laboratory and significant differences at a number of wavelength positions were detected. There were differences in terms of absolute reflectance, depths of absorption features and the relative position of change in terms of the wavelength. The differences between species were more noticeable in the first derivative spectra when compared with the raw spectra. This was attributed to the ability of derivatives to remove the noise from raw reflectance spectra. The results also indicate the possibility of utilizing the common vegetation indices and ratios used in remote sensing for discriminating species and highlight the need to select spectral channels at pertinent positions where the differences are the greatest. This study has identified many of these positions in relation to some eucalyptus species. However, the study also shows that there is no single wavelength which will discriminate between all species and it also shows that even with hyperspectral data, issues with detailed level of mapping will still exist.},

Although the fungus' detection is important for the evaluation of biological control effectiveness and decision making, in-situ diagnosis is not always possible. The presented approach describes the identification of systemically infected S. marianum plants by using field spectroscopy and hierarchical self-organizing maps. An experimental field that contained both healthy and artificially inoculated S. marianum plants was used to acquire leaf spectra using a handheld visible and near-infrared spectrometer (310–1100 nm). Three supervised hierarchical self-organizing models, including Supervised Kohonen Network (SKN), Counter propagation Artificial Neural Network (CP-ANN) and XY-Fusion network (XY-F) were utilized for the identification of the systemically infected S. marianum plants. As input features to the classifiers, the pre-processed spectral signatures were used. The pre-processing of the spectra included normalisation, second derivative and principal component extraction. The systemically infected S. marianum identification rates using SKN and CP-ANN reached high overall accuracy (up to 90\%) and even higher using the XY-F (95.16\%). The results demonstrate the potential for a high accuracy identification of systemically infected S. marianum plants during vegetative growth, with the assistance of hierarchical self-organizing maps.},

The three aquatic types—submerged, floating, and emergent—exhibited clear differences in their spectral reflectance and can be distinguished on the basis of discriminant analysis using reflectance parameters. This technique can be used in large-area mapping of aquatic plants. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the simple ratio (SR) were well correlated with chlorophyll content, photosynthetic efficiency, and biomass in the emergent species. New, narrow-bandwidth indices and reflectance indices calculated from first and second derivative spectra were strongly correlated with the ratio of secondary and protective pigments to chlorophyll a and with epoxidation state of the xanthophyll cycle pigments, and therefore, with photosynthetic efficiency. These new indices may be useful in the remote sensing of plant physiological status.},

The first classification is between Broadleaves and pines; the second classification is between Broadleaves, Corsican Pines, and Scots Pines, and the third classification is between six tree species including different ages of Corsican and Scots Pines. These three classifications are performed by having single- and multiple-endmember and considering five different spectral measure techniques (SMTs) in combination with reflectance spectra (ReflS), first and second derivative spectra. The result shows that using single-endmember, derivative spectra are not useful for a more challenging classification. This is further emphasized in multiple-endmember classification, where all SMTs perform better in ReflS rather than derivative in all classifications. Furthermore, using derivative spectra, discrimination accuracy become more dependent on the type of SMTs, especially in single-endmember. By employing multiple-endmember, the within-species variation is significantly reduced, thereby, the remaining challenge in discriminating tree species with different ages is only due to the between-species similarity. Overall, discrimination accuracies around 92.4, 76.8, and 71.5\% are obtained using original reflectance and multiple-endmember for the first, second, and third classification, which is around 14.3, 17, and 8.3\% higher than what were obtained in single-endmember classifications, respectively. Also, amongst the five SMTs, Euclidean distance (in both single- and multiple-endmember) and Jeffreys–Matusita distance (in single-endmember and derivative spectra) provided the highest discrimination accuracies in different classifications. Furthermore, when discrimination become more challenging from the first to second and third classification, the performance difference between different SMTs is increased from 1.4 to 3.8 and 7.3\%, respectively. The study shows high potential of multiple-endmember to be employed in remote sensing applications in the future for improving tree species discrimination accuracy.},

	abstract = {Yellow rust (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. Tritici), powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis) and wheat aphid (Sitobion avenae F.) infestation are three serious conditions that have a severe impact on yield and grain quality of winter wheat worldwide. Discrimination among these three stressors is of practical importance, given that specific procedures (i.e. adoption of fungicide and insecticide) are needed to treat different diseases and insects. This study examines the potential of hyperspectral sensor systems in discriminating these three stressors at leaf level. Reflectance spectra of leaves infected with yellow rust, powdery mildew and aphids were measured at the early grain filling stage. Normalization was performed prior to spectral analysis on all three groups of samples for removing differences in the spectral baseline among different cultivars. To obtain appropriate bands and spectral features (SFs) for stressor discrimination and damage intensity estimation, a correlation analysis and an independent t-test were used jointly. Based on the most efficient bands/SFs, models for discriminating stressors and estimating stressor intensity were established by Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (FLDA) and partial least square regression (PLSR), respectively. The results showed that the performance of the discrimination model was satisfactory in general, with an overall accuracy of 0.75. However, the discrimination model produced varied classification accuracies among different types of diseases and insects. The regression model produced reasonable estimates of stress intensity, with an R2 of 0.73 and a RMSE of 0.148. This study illustrates the potential use of hyperspectral information in discriminating yellow rust, powdery mildew and wheat aphid infestation in winter wheat. In practice, it is important to extend the discriminative analysis from leaf level to canopy level.},

	abstract = {The vegetation indices from hyperspectral data have been shown to be effective for indirect monitoring of plant diseases. However, a limitation of these indices is that they cannot distinguish different diseases on crops. We aimed to develop new spectral indices (NSIs) that would be useful for identifying different diseases on crops. Three different pests (powdery mildew, yellow rust, and aphids) in winter wheat were used in this study. The new optimized spectral indices were derived from a weighted combination of a single band and a normalized wavelength difference of two bands. The most and least relevant wavelengths for different diseases were first extracted from leaf spectral data using the RELIEF-F algorithm. Reflectance of a single band extracted from the most relevant wavelengths and the normalized wavelength difference from all possible combinations of the most and least relevant wavelengths were used to form the optimized spectral indices. The classification accuracies of these new indices for healthy leaves and leaves infected with powdery mildew, yellow rust, and aphids were 86.5\%, 85.2\%, 91.6\%, and 93.5\%, respectively. We also applied these NSIs for nonimaging canopy data of winter wheat, and the classification results of different diseases were promising. For the leaf scale, the powdery mildew-index (PMI) correlated well with the disease index (DI), supporting the use of the PMI to invert the severity of powdery mildew. For the canopy scale, the detection of the severity of yellow rust using the yellow rust-index (YRI) showed a high coefficient of determination ( mbiR2 = 0.86) between the estimated DI and its observations, suggesting that the NSIs may improve disease detection in precision agriculture application.},

A plant's growth rate is seen as a central element of its ecological strategy, and as determined by its traits. Yet the literature is inconsistent about the empirical correlation between functional traits and growth, casting doubt on the capacity of some prominent traits to influence growth rate.



*
We propose that traits should influence growth in a way that depends on the size of individual plants. We outline mechanisms and hypotheses based on new theoretical work and test these predictions in tree species using a meta-analysis of 103 studies ({\textgreater} 500 correlations) for five traits (specific leaf area, wood density, maximum height, seed mass and maximum assimilation rate). We also recorded data for 14 other traits commonly used in the trait literature. To capture the effects of plant size, we tested for a shift in the direction of correlation between growth rates and each trait across three ontogenetic stages: seedling, sapling and adult.



*
Results were consistent with predictions, although there were some limitations arising from unequal numbers of observation across ontogenetic stages. Specific leaf area was correlated with relative growth rate in seedlings but not in adult plants. Correlations of growth with wood density were not affected by ontogenetic stage. Seed mass, assimilation rate and maximum height were correlated with relative growth rate only in one ontogenetic stage category: seedlings, seedlings and adults, respectively.



*
Although we were able to confirm several of our theoretical predictions, major knowledge gaps still exist in the trait literature. For example, for one-third of the traits considered, the majority ({\textgreater} 75\%) of reported correlations with growth came from the same ontogenetic stage.



*
Synthesis. We show for some traits, how trait–growth correlations change in a predictable way with plant size. Our understanding of plant strategies should shift away from describing species as having a fixed growth strategy throughout their life (on a continuous axis from slow to fast growth), in favour of a size-dependent growth trajectories.},

This pathogen has long been recognized as the cause of root galls (hyperplasia) and the economically important disease powdery scab on tubers (modified stolons). The significance for plant productivity of the zoosporangium stages of the pathogen in potato roots has only recently begun to be documented. Two experiments are described that assessed effects of S. subterranea root infection on potato plant root function and productivity. A greenhouse experiment measured root function and plant parameters for eight potato cultivars with markedly different susceptibilities to tuber powdery scab. Water uptake and plant growth were reduced by S. subterranea inoculation in all eight cultivars. The magnitudes of these negative effects, and intensities of root hyperplasia, differed among the cultivars, but were not related to respective susceptibilities to tuber powdery scab. A field trial assessed root function and plant productivity for a cultivar (Iwa) that is very susceptible to Spongospora tuber and root diseases. Soil water content beneath uninoculated plants was consistently less than for inoculated plants, indicating that inoculation reduced water uptake (root function). Inoculation reduced shoot and root dry weights, and reduced weight of tubers per plant by 42\%. Spongospora subterranea causes three diseases of potato: root membrane dysfunction, root hyperplasia and tuber powdery scab. The root diseases caused by the pathogen are likely to be important both for powdery scab management and for deleterious effects on potato crop yields.},

	abstract = {Stripe (yellow) rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is a serious disease of wheat occurring in most wheat areas with cool and moist weather conditions during the growing season. The basidiomycete fungus is an obligate biotrophic parasite that is difficult to culture on artificial media. Pst is a macrocyclic, heteroecious fungus that requires both primary (wheat or grasses) and alternate (Berberis or Mahonia spp.) host plants to complete its life cycle. Urediniospores have the capacity for wind dispersal over long distances, which may, under high inoculum pressure, extend to thousands of kilometres from the initial infection sites. Stripe rust, which is considered to be the current major rust disease affecting winter cereal production across the world, has been studied intensively for over a century. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the Pst–wheat pathosystem, with emphasis on the life cycle, uredinial infection process, population biology of the pathogen, genes for stripe rust resistance in wheat and molecular perspectives of wheat–Pst interactions.


Taxonomy

The stripe rust pathogen, Puccinia striiformis Westend. (Ps), is classified in kingdom Fungi, phylum Basidiomycota, class Urediniomycetes, order Uredinales, family Pucciniaceae, genus Puccinia. Ps is separated below the species level by host specialization on various grass genera, comprising up to nine formae speciales, of which P. striiformis f. sp. tritici Erikss. (Pst) causes stripe (or yellow) rust on wheat.


Host range

Uredinial/telial hosts: Pst mainly infects common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), durum wheat (T. turgidum var. durum L.), cultivated emmer wheat (T. dicoccum Schrank), wild emmer wheat (T. dicoccoides Korn) and triticale (Triticosecale). Pst can infect certain cultivated barleys (Hordeum vulgare L.) and rye (Secale cereale L.), but generally does not cause severe epidemics. In addition, Pst may infect naturalized and improved pasture grass species, such as Elymus canadensis L., Leymus secalinus Hochst, Agropyron spp. Garetn, Hordeum spp. L., Phalaris spp. L and Bromus unioloides Kunth. Pycnial/aecial (alternative) hosts: Barberry (Berberis chinensis, B. koreana, B. holstii, B. vulgaris, B. shensiana, B. potaninii, B. dolichobotrys, B. heteropoda, etc.) and Oregon grape (Mahonia aquifolium).


Disease symptoms

Stripe rust appears as a mass of yellow to orange urediniospores erupting from pustules arranged in long, narrow stripes on leaves (usually between veins), leaf sheaths, glumes and awns on susceptible plants. Resistant wheat cultivars are characterized by various infection types from no visual symptoms to small hypersensitive flecks to uredinia surrounded by chlorosis or necrosis with restricted urediniospore production. On seedlings, uredinia produced by the infection of a single urediniospore are not confined by leaf veins, but progressively emerge from the infection site in all directions, potentially covering the entire leaf surface. Individual uredinial pustules are oblong, 0.4–0.7 mm in length and 0.1 mm in width. Urediniospores are broadly ellipsoidal to broadly obovoid, (16–)18–30(–32) × (15–)17–27(–28) μm, with a mean of 24.5 × 21.6 μm, yellow to orange in colour, echinulate, and with 6–18 scattered germ pores. Urediniospores can germinate rapidly when free moisture (rain or dew) occurs on leaf surfaces and when the temperatures range is between 7 and 12 °C. At higher temperatures or during the later growing stages of the host, black telia are often produced, which are pulvinate to oblong, 0.2–0.7 mm in length and 0.1 mm in width. The teliospores are predominantly two-celled, dark brown with thick walls, mostly oblong-clavate, (24–)31–56(–65) × (11–)14–25(–29) μm in length and width, and rounded or flattened at the apex.},

	abstract = {In gene-for-gene systems, resistance of a plant to a pathogen is due to the ‘recognition’ by plant surveillance system (i.e. plant resistance gene product) of a pathogen avirulence determinant encoded by an avirulence gene to eventually result in triggering of plant immunity. Avirulence proteins (or products) actually are effectors involved in pathogenicity. In viruses, virtually all the proteins can behave as avirulence determinants. In all other cases, avirulence genes are extremely diverse, being often species or isolate/strain-specific and rarely have matches in sequence databases. They often are specifically expressed or strongly over-expressed during plant–pathogen interaction and the encoded proteins show the presence of secretion signals and translocation signals (e.g. the Type III secretion signal for bacteria). Avirulence genes seem to be submitted to high-speed diversifying selection allowing the pathogen to diversify its effector repertoire and rapidly escape recognition by the plant resistance gene.

Key concepts
Key concepts




* Effectors of plant pathogens are pathogen molecules that manipulate host cell structure and function thereby facilitating infection.

* Effectors often contribute quantitatively to pathogen aggressiveness and are dispensable for the pathogen life cycle.

* In the course of plant–pathogen co-evolution, plants have evolved receptors that detect pathogen effectors (or the effect of the effectors on a plant target) and activate defence responses.

* The effectors specifically recognized by ‘matching’ resistance proteins (termed R proteins) are termed avirulence (AVR) proteins.

* This forms the basis of the gene-for-gene concept, genetically demonstrated by Flor between 1942 and 1955 and stating that plants producing a specific R gene product are resistant towards a pathogen that produces the corresponding Avr gene product whereas whenever one of the genes or both are lacking the plant is susceptible and disease ensues.

* In wild plant and pathogen populations, avirulence and resistance are discontinuous traits, only present in part of the population. Thus resistance will be applied against only part of the pathogen population (harbouring the corresponding Avr allele) and pathogen will only be avirulent towards part of the plant population (harbouring the matching resistance gene).

* All plant pathogens from viruses to nematodes, but also some pests like aphids produce avirulence proteins.

* When submitted to resistant populations of plants, pathogens can alter or delete their avirulence proteins to avoid defence elicitation, at risk of a fitness cost associated with loss-of-function of those effectors.},

	abstract = {Plant disease resistance protects plants from pathogens in two ways: by pre-formed structures and chemicals, and by infection-induced responses of the immune system. Relative to a susceptible plant, disease resistance is the reduction of pathogen growth on or in the plant (and hence a reduction of disease), while the term disease tolerance describes plants that exhibit little disease damage despite substantial pathogen levels. Disease outcome is determined by the three-way interaction of the pathogen, the plant and the environmental conditions (an interaction known as the disease triangle).
Defense-activating compounds can move cell-to-cell and systemically through the plant vascular system. However, plants do not have circulating immune cells, so most cell types exhibit a broad suite of antimicrobial defenses. Although obvious qualitative differences in disease resistance can be observed when multiple specimens are compared (allowing classification as “resistant” or “susceptible” after infection by the same pathogen strain at similar inoculum levels in similar environments), a gradation of quantitative differences in disease resistance is more typically observed between plant strains or genotypes. Plants consistently resist certain pathogens but succumb to others; resistance is usually specific to certain pathogen species or pathogen strains.},

Duplication of the effector target gene or independent evolution of a target mimic could relax evolutionary constraints and result in a decoy that would be solely involved in effector perception.

Germination of teliospores, basidiospores, and urediniospores was assessed at seven temperatures, with or without light. The effect of temperature on infection was also assessed. As was the effect of dew period length on germination of teliospores, production of basidiospores and infection. Teliospores and urediniospores germinated between 5 and 30 °C, with an optimum at 15–25 °C. Basidiospores were produced and germinated at temperatures between 5 and 25 °C, with an optimum at 15–20 °C. The optimum temperature for infection by basidiospores was 15–20 °C. All spore types germinated in 6–24 h under optimal conditions. However, production of basidiospores was severely reduced if teliospore germination was interrupted by dry periods, even if teliospores were re-wetted. Symptoms and telia developed on only one plant exposed to a dew period of less than 12 h, with a dew period of 48 h found to be optimal. Artificial inoculation experiments showed that U. acaciae was only able to infect young, growing tissues. Results of this research can be used to develop an artificial inoculation protocol for resistance screening and in disease risk modelling and forecasting.},

	abstract = {In Precision Agriculture (PA), the decision support system is expected to be able to assist determining the needs of the farm. One of the crucial needs is to specify the amount of different fertilizers to be used, and also distinguished hydration levels of crops. The amount of necessary fertilizers to apply is directly related with the area occupied by a certain type of plant, and with the hydration levels of such area. In order to achieve such a goal, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) can be used to scan over an area, while detecting and classifying the type of vegetation in herbaceous crops. The majority of current monitoring technologies are very expensive, or the low cost systems use cameras that will gather information only in the visible spectrum. Therefore, we propose a low-cost multi-spectral system, where an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) was equipped with a set of exchangeable filters over a camera, connected to a Raspberry Pi (RPi). Two classifiers were implemented and optimized in order to maximize the true positive rate (TPR) while minimize the false positive rate (FPR). The entire system is automated and the classification output is provided from the RPi to a ground station in real-time, by a Wi-Fi socket connection. The classifiers have shown to be able to distinguish, based on our sensor data, two types of vineyard and tree species of plants. For comparison purposes, we present results showing the performance of both classifiers while using data gathered by our system. The Region Of Interest (ROI) was identified by a thresholding algorithm based on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) measurements.},

	abstract = {Two critical limitations for using current satellite sensors in real-time crop management are the lack of imagery with optimum spatial and spectral resolutions and an unfavorable revisit time for most crop stress-detection applications. Alternatives based on manned airborne platforms are lacking due to their high operational costs. A fundamental requirement for providing useful remote sensing products in agriculture is the capacity to combine high spatial resolution and quick turnaround times. Remote sensing sensors placed on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) could fill this gap, providing low-cost approaches to meet the critical requirements of spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions. This paper demonstrates the ability to generate quantitative remote sensing products by means of a helicopter-based UAV equipped with inexpensive thermal and narrowband multispectral imaging sensors. During summer of 2007, the platform was flown over agricultural fields, obtaining thermal imagery in the 7.5-13-mum region (40-cm resolution) and narrowband multispectral imagery in the 400-800-nm spectral region (20-cm resolution). Surface reflectance and temperature imagery were obtained, after atmospheric corrections with MODTRAN. Biophysical parameters were estimated using vegetation indices, namely, normalized difference vegetation index, transformed chlorophyll absorption in reflectance index/optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index, and photochemical reflectance index (PRI), coupled with SAILH and FLIGHT models. As a result, the image products of leaf area index, chlorophyll content (C ab), and water stress detection from PRI index and canopy temperature were produced and successfully validated. This paper demonstrates that results obtained with a low-cost UAV system for agricultural applications yielded comparable estimations, if not better, than those obtained by traditional manned airborne sensors.},

The same index can be used for remote sensing from Landsat TM and the EOS-HIRIS sensor. The index takes advantage of the presence of the blue channel (0.47.±0.01 μm) in the MODIS sensor, in addition to the red (0.66±0.025 μm) and the near-IR (0.865±0.02 μm) channels that compose the present normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The resistance of the ARVI to atmospheric effects (in comparison to the NDVI) is accomplished by a self-correction process for the atmospheric effect on the red channel, using the difference in the radiance between the blue and the red channels to correct the radiance in the red channel. Simulations using radiative transfer computations on arithmetic and natural surface spectra, for various atmospheric conditions, show that ARVI has a similar dynamic range to the NDVI, but is, on average, four times less sensitive to atmospheric effects than the NDVI},

Stochastic hidden Markov models (HMMs) are efficient yet computationally demanding classification approach which can simulate crop dynamics, exploiting the spectral information of their phenological states and the relations between these states. This letter aims to present a methodology which achieves accurate classification results while maintaining a low computational cost. A classification framework based on HMMs was developed, and different spectral indices were generated from the time series of Landsat ETM+ and RapidEye imagery, for modeling crop vegetation dynamics over a Mediterranean rural area, with high spatiotemporal crop heterogeneity. To further improve the HMMs indices classification, separability analysis and two different decision fusion strategies were tested. The assessment of the classification accuracy, along with an evaluation of the computational cost, indicated that the green-red vegetation index produced the most favorable results among the individual spectral indices. Although the decision fusion based on an integration of a reliability factor increased the overall accuracy by 3.1\%, this came at the cost of computational time, compared to the separability analysis model which required less processing time.},

The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the NYC Street Tree Census, and access to major green spaces served as measures of greenness, while proximity to waterfront areas represented access to blue space. Associations between these factors and adverse birth outcomes, including preterm birth, term birthweight, term low birthweight, and small for gestational age, were evaluated via mixed-effects linear and logistic regression models. The analyses were conducted separately for women living in deprived neighborhoods to test for differential effects on mothers in these areas. The results indicate that women in deprived neighborhoods suffer from higher rates adverse birth outcomes and lower levels of residential greenness. In adjusted models, a significant inverse association between nearby street trees and the odds of preterm birth was found for all women. However, we did not identify a consistent significant relationship between adverse birth outcomes and NDVI, access to major green spaces, or waterfront access when individual covariates were taken into account.},

Variations in water level height, nutrient condition, light availability and water temperature affect the growth and species composition of SAV. Detailed information about seasonal variations in littoral bottom coverage are still unknown, although these effects are expected to mask climate change-related long-term changes, as derived by snapshots of standard monitoring methods included in the European Water Framework Directive. Remote sensing offers concepts to map SAV quickly, within large areas, and at short intervals. This study analyses the potential of a semi-empirical method to map littoral bottom coverage by a multi-seasonal approach. Depth-invariant indices were calculated for four Atmospheric \&amp; Topographic Correction (ATCOR2) atmospheric corrected RapidEye data sets acquired at Lake Kummerow, Germany, between June and August 2015. RapidEye data evaluation was supported by in situ measurements of the diffuse attenuation coefficient of the water column and bottom reflectance. The processing chain was able to differentiate between SAV and sandy sediment. The successive increase of SAV coverage from June to August was correctly monitored. Comparisons with in situ and Google Earth imagery revealed medium accuracies (kappa coefficient = 0.61, overall accuracy = 72.2\%). The analysed time series further revealed how water constituents and temporary surface phenomena such as sun glint or algal blooms influence the identification success of lake bottom substrates. An abundant algal bloom biased the interpretability of shallow water substrate such that a differentiation of sediments and SAV patches failed completely. Despite the documented limitations, mapping of SAV using RapidEye seems possible, even in eutrophic lakes.},

Herein, we present and review robotic applications on plant pathology and management, and emerging agricultural technologies for intra-urban agriculture. Greenhouse advanced management systems and technologies have been greatly developed in the last years, integrating IoT and WSN (Wireless Sensor Network). Machine learning, machine vision, and AI (Artificial Intelligence) have been utilized and applied in agriculture for automated and robotic farming. Intelligence technologies, using machine vision/learning, have been developed not only for planting, irrigation, weeding (to some extent), pruning, and harvesting, but also for plant disease detection and identification. However, plant disease detection still represents an intriguing challenge, for both abiotic and biotic stress. Many recognition methods and technologies for identifying plant disease symptoms have been successfully developed; still, the majority of them require a controlled environment for data acquisition to avoid false positives. Machine learning methods (e.g., deep and transfer learning) present promising results for improving image processing and plant symptom identification. Nevertheless, diagnostic specificity is a challenge for microorganism control and should drive the development of mechatronics and robotic solutions for disease management.},

This was appropriately modified to detect bloom of red Noctiluca in coastal waters of the Bay of Bengal. Additional Rrs data at longer wavelengths viz. 667 and 678 nm were included in the existing algorithm, and the spectral shapes were accounted to detect the bloom of red Noctiluca. The classification scheme discriminates red Noctiluca from the green form of the same species and diatom. Phytoplankton group/species products were generated using the modified approach and validated with the reported events of red and green Noctiluca blooms in the Indian coastal waters. The present study also highlights two specific results based on MODIS retrieved time-series phytoplankton group/species image analysis: first, the observation of coexistence of diatom, red, and green Noctiluca in coastal waters of the north-western Bay of Bengal, and the second, phytoplankton community shift resulting in red/green Noctiluca proliferation following diatom.},

Physiological measurements are considered the most accurate way of assessing plant health status. In this paper, we researched the use of an in situ hyperspectral remote sensor to detect plant water status in winter wheat infected with powdery mildew. Using a diseased nursery field and artificially inoculated open field experiments, we detected the canopy spectra of wheat at different developmental stages and under different degrees of disease severity. At the same time, destructive sampling was carried out for physical tests to investigate the change of physiological parameters under the condition of disease. Selected vegetation indices (VIs) were mostly comprised of green bands, and correlation coefficients between these common VIs and plant water content (PWC) were generally 0.784 - 0.902 (p {\textless} 0.001), indicating the green waveband may have great potential in the evaluation of water content of winter wheat under powdery mildew stress. The Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) was sensitive to physiological response influenced by powdery mildew, and the relationships of PRI with chlorophyll content, the maximum quantum efficiency of PSII photochemistry (Fv/Fm), and the potential activity of PSII photochemistry (Fv/Fo) were good with R2 = 0.639, 0.833, 0.808, respectively. Linear regressions showed PRI demonstrated a steady relationship with PWC across different growth conditions, with R2 = 0.817 and RMSE = 2.17. The acquired PRI model of wheat under the powdery mildew stress has a good compatibility to different experimental fields from booting stage to filling stage compared with the traditional water signal vegetation indices, WBI, FWBI1, and FWBI2. The verification results with independent data showed that PRI still performed better with R2 = 0.819 between measured and predicted, and corresponding RE = 8.26\%. Thus, PRI is recommended as a potentially reliable indicator of plant water content in winter wheat with powdery mildew stress. The results will help to understand the physical state of the plant, and provide technical support for disease control using remote sensing during wheat production.},

	abstract = {Early detection of water stress is critical for precision farming for improving crop productivity and fruit quality. To investigate varying rootstock and irrigation interactions in an open agricultural ecosystem, different irrigation treatments were implemented in a vineyard experimental site either: (i) nonirrigated (NIR); (ii) with full replacement of evapotranspiration (FIR); or (iii) intermediate irrigation (INT, 50\% replacement of evapotranspiration). In the summers 2014 and 2015, we collected leaf reflectance factor spectra of the vineyard using field spectroscopy along with grapevine physiological parameters. To comprehensively analyze the field-collected hyperspectral data, various band combinations were used to calculate the normalized difference spectral index (NDSI) along with 26 various indices from the literature. Then, the relationship between the indices and plant physiological parameters were examined and the strongest relationships were determined. We found that newly-identified NDSIs always performed better than the indices from the literature, and stomatal conductance (Gs) was the plant physiological parameter that showed the highest correlation with NDSI(R603,R558) calculated using leaf reflectance factor spectra (R2 = 0.720). Additionally, the best NDSI(R685,R415) for non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) was determined (R2 = 0.681). Gs resulted in being a proxy of water stress. Therefore, the partial least squares regression (PLSR) method was utilized to develop a predictive model for Gs. Our results showed that the PLSR model was inferior to the NDSI in Gs estimation (R2 = 0.680). The variable importance in the projection (VIP) was then employed to investigate the most important wavelengths that were most effective in determining Gs. The VIP analysis confirmed that the yellow band improves the prediction ability of hyperspectral reflectance factor data in Gs estimation. The findings of this study demonstrate the potential of hyperspectral spectroscopy data in motoring plant stress response.},

Mountains are useful areas for studying impacts associated with climatic change, as their significant biological diversity often varies in conjunction with elevation. While previous studies have used remote sensing to quantify the impacts of elevation differences on land surface phenology descriptors in mountains, they have focused almost exclusively on the Northern Hemisphere. This study fills this gap by presenting a 15-year phenological time-series for the Australian Alps derived using data from the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Phenological descriptors were estimated from the MODIS time-series and they corresponded with the start, end and duration of the growing period (SGP, EGP and DGP, respectively) for the major vegetation communities in the Australian Alps. Results indicated that the descriptor corresponding with the start of the growing period was more sensitive to changes in elevation, while the results for the end of the growing period descriptor were more uniform, particularly at lower elevations. For all but the highest elevation areas in the Australian Alps, the results indicated an overall trend towards an earlier start and later end to the growing period, culminating in a longer duration of the growing period. These findings are consistent with those previously reported in the literature, though they are likely influenced by the fire history of the alpine areas.,},

	abstract = {Ecosystem services of tidal wetlands depend upon hydrology and vegetation, which in turn vary with elevation differences on the order of centimeters. Variability on such a fine scale is not captured in digital elevation models prepared from conventionally acquired LiDAR data products that generally have a spatial resolution of 0.5–1.0 m and vertical uncertainties up to 15 cm. Until recently, capturing critical fine scale features required laborious, hands-on field surveys that took days to collect data and time limitations usually required surveys to be restricted to selected areas of a wetland. Using Structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry and a small unmanned aerial vehicle, precise three-dimensional point clouds, digital surface models (DSM) and color orthomosaics were produced for three salt marshes in Eastern Canada. Vertical and horizontal measurements from the SfM photogrammetry compared favorably to those taken with a Differential Global Positioning System DGPS). Average horizontal displacements of 1.0–2.9 cm were found across the three salt marshes with an average elevation difference of 2.7 cm (± 1.7 cm) in comparison to DGPS. Analysis of the relationship of elevation between points taken with the DGPS and extracted from the SfM DSM gave an R2 of 0.99. With a ground sampling distance of 2.3 cm our SfM photogrammetry generated models captured variations in topography associated with geomorphic features such as creeks, ponds, channel edges, and logs not visible in the DSM prepared from LiDAR of the same sites. SfM photogrammetry enables mapping of important hydrological features, such as creeks carrying drainage from upland watersheds or connectivity of ponds on the wetland surface. The former are important for transport of contaminants or diadromous fish, and the latter is important for resident fish, water birds, and mosquito larvae. Using SfM to distinguish vegetation structure that may indicate vegetation composition will enable more informed analyses of elevational controls on plant distribution and better prediction of their fate with sea level rise.},

An increase of reflectance between 550 and 740 nm accompanied senescence-induced degradation of chlorophyll (Chl), whereas in the range 400–500 nm it remained low, due to retention of carotenoids (Car). It was found that both leaf senescence and fruit ripening affect the difference between reflectance (R) near 670 and 500 nm (R678−R500), depending on pigment composition. The plant senescing reflectance index in the form (R678−R500)/R750 was found to be sensitive to the Car/Chl ratio, and was used as a quantitative measure of leaf senescence and fruit ripening. The changes in the index were followed during leaf senescence, and natural and ethylene-induced fruit ripening. This novel index can be used for estimating the onset, the stage, relative rates and kinetics of senescence/ripening processes.},

Sonic oscillation was used to separate germ tubes from germinating uredospores of Uromyces phaseoli var. typica. Uniformly 14C-labeled wall fractions from both structures were prepared by repeated low speed centrifugation and extraction with polar and nonpolar solvents. Based on amino acid analysis, approximately 6 and 16\% of the carbon from uredospore and germ tube walls, respectively, was present in amino acids readily accessible to protease. Covalent linkages between amino acid and carbohydrate of walls was indicated by analysis of fragments prepared by mild hydrolytic procedures and separated by column chromatography and paper electrophoresis. The existence of protein in wall structures may resolve some previous uncertainty about the occurrence of protein biosynthesis during germination of rust fungi. Glucose, mannose, and glucosamine were the only carbohydrate components identified in both germ tubes and uredospore walls but different percentages were observed (germ tubes 28: 16: 16; uredospore 6: 36: 6). In germ tubes, most of the glucosamine was present in linkages hydrolyzed only by strong acid treatment, suggesting chitin-like polymers. In uredospore walls, glucosamine appears to be associated with red uredospore pigment which has properties similar to those of a melanin. Approximately 20\% of the carbon in walls could not be identified with known compounds, partially because of degradation during the analytical procedures.},

Contemporary research, in contrast, has begun to show that the pigments can significantly influence the way a leaf responds to environmental stress. Anthocyanins have been implicated in tolerance to stressors as diverse as drought, UV-B, and heavy metals, as well as resistance to herbivores and pathogens. By absorbing high-energy quanta, anthocyanic cell vacuoles both protect chloroplasts from the photoinhibitory and photooxidative effects of strong light, and prevent the catabolism of photolabile defence compounds. Anthocyanins also mitigate photooxidative injury in leaves by efficiently scavenging free radicals and reactive oxygen species. Far from being a useless by-product of the flavonoid pathway, these red pigments may in some instances be critical for plant survival.},

Infrared reflectance was comparatively unresponsive to stress, but increased at 1,400-2,500 nm with severe leaf dehydration and the accompanying decreased absorption by water.

Anthocyanin absorption maxima in vivo, as estimated with spectrophotometry of intact anthocyanic versus acyanic leaves and microspectrophotometry of vacuoles in the leaf cross-sections, were found between 537 nm and 542 nm, showing a red shift of 5–20 nm compared with the corresponding maxima in acidic water–methanol extracts. In non-senescent leaves, strong anthocyanin absorption was found between 500 nm and 600 nm (with a 70–80 nm apparent bandwidth). By and large, absorption by anthocyanin in leaves followed a modified form of the Lambert–Beer law, showing a linear trend up to a content of nearly 50 nmol cm−2, and permitting thereby a non-invasive determination of anthocyanin content. The apparent specific absorption coefficients of anthocyanins at 550 nm showed no substantial dependence on the species. Anthocyanin contribution to total light absorption at 550 nm was followed in maple leaves in the course of autumn senescence. Photoprotection by vacuolar anthocyanins is discussed with special regard to their distribution within a leaf; radiation screening by anthocyanins predominantly localized in the epidermal cells in A. platanoides and C. avellana leaves was also evaluated.},

The effects of different spectra features, wavebands, and the number of the samples used in modeling on the performances of the models were assessed. The results showed that, in the spectral region of 325–1075 nm, the model with the spectral feature of 2nd derivative of Pseudoabsorption index had better accuracy than others. The average accuracy rate was 97.28\% for the training set and 92.98\% for the testing set.
