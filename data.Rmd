## Raw data 

In our previous study (Heim et al., 2018), leaf spectral data were collected on 
a lemon myrtle (_Backhousia citriodora_) plantation in northern New South Wales, 
Australia [28.6911090 S, 124 153.295480 E](https://goo.gl/maps/3zDQJfcQQf52), 
and were organized in a single `csv` file. Data structure is as follows:

```{r dat, echo=FALSE}
